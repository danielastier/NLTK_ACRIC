In high school before she converted, Jaelyn Young was an honor student, cheerleader and homecoming maid. A radicalized young woman from Mississippi pleaded guilty to trying to join the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) in Syria. Jaelyn Young, 20, wrote a farewell letter to her family, "I found the contacts, made arrangements, planned the departure. I am guilty of what you soon will find out.” “Do not alert the authorities," she continued, "I will contact you soon. I am safe. Don't look for me because you won't be able to retrieve me if you tried. I am leaving to become a medic." Young, who had a background in math and chemistry, had taken her mother’s credit card to buy tickets to Istanbul for both her and her new husband, Muhammad Dakhlalla, who she convinced to join the terrorist group. In high school, Young was an honor student, cheerleader and homecoming maid. She converted to Islam while studying chemistry at Mississippi State University. One of her parents is a school administrator and the other a police officer who served in the Navy reserves. "After her conversion, Young distanced herself from family and friends and felt spending time with non-Muslims would be a bad influence," prosecutors stated. She donned a burka and began espousing extreme beliefs. Prosecutors said that she objected to how Muslims were treated in the United States and the UK, and began thinking of Islamic State jihadis as liberators. She expressed approval of a gay man being thrown off a roof by ISIS as well as the shootings of military personnel in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Undercover FBI intercepted her online correspondence when she began making inquiries about how to travel to Syria. Young, who is charged with conspiring to provide material support to a terrorist organization, faces up to 20 years in prison, $250,000 in fines and a lifetime of probation. Dakhlalla also pleaded guilty to a similar charge.
