0,"Could the proudly racist rhetoric of local and national leaders be the final fight of a white supremacy that is dying ""Something's happening in the United States We see it in the protests in the streets , we hear it in the speeches of our leaders We can feel it in our fearful hearts when we watch the news There is a … heat , here Something is brewing We are brewing Of course , heat is nothing new This great melting pot has been on the stove for a long time , and has boiled over before When slavery boiled us , we turned down the heat with freedom When Jim Crow boiled us , we turned down the heat with equal rights under law But the burner was always on The melting pot always feels the heat , and though we might turn it down a bit from time to time , there's still heat , and more heat This melting pot is boiling Nowhere is this more evident than the current presidential campaign , with its rhetoric that borders on white-hot racism The entertainer Donald Trump headlines this Using racist statements and outright lies , he's run the gamut from openly mocking blacks , Hispanics , and people with disabilities - to promoting Nazi-era protocols to identify Muslims His bigoted rhetoric , coupled with an actual admission that he doesn't bother checking facts , combine to give the US a chance of having a president with the intellectual capacity and emotional control of a toddler having a temper tantrum And make no mistake , Trump is a real contender for the throne - something that is in itself terrifying But Trump is not alone The Grand Old Party ( GOP ) is a seething cauldron of racism and xenophobia We saw this when the Syrian refugee crisis , which began more than four years ago while none of them were paying any attention , became a political platform ""Trump's neo-Nazi Muslim ID cards was shocking , but Ted Cruz suggested we should restrict entry to allow only Christians in , and Rubio has essentially called for the Christian version of Sharia law Even Ben Carson compared Syrian refugees to rabid dogs Send us your tired , your hungry , your white and your Christian This is our America , where even a black man will easily use racism for political gain None of this is limited to the presidential race Republican Rhode Island State Senator Elaine Morgan thinks Muslim refugees should live in segregated camps and more than half of US governors took the stance of publicly refusing Syrian refugees - this despite the fact that they have no say in the matter because refugee immigration is regulated under federal law Even Roanoke - Virginia's Mayor David Bowers thinks that we should look at the Japanese internment camps of World War II as our example for housing refugees Our darkest hour has become an inspiration Proudly racist rhetoric from local to national leaders suggests that our American melting pot is boiling with a heat that it hasn't felt since the mid - 1800s and the 1960s Black Lives Matter protesters proclaim : "" This ain't your mama's civil rights movement , "" while white supremacist groups rally with what feels like increased support from political leaders Latino communities exercise increased political power even as the Supreme Court threatens to diminish the Latino vote in favour of more voting strength for white populations The US is boiling , and politicians know it , especially Trump Happy to make money from Muslims , he pals around with them in Dubai calling them his friends , but he'll stand on a stump saying we should ban Muslims from the country because he knows that such racist language will win him votes Meanwhile , we have a two-term democratic president , and if history is any judge , there's very little the Democrats can do to win As evidence , see the ineffectual campaigns of Clinton and Sanders - both of whom seem dedicated to little more than checking the "" at least I tried "" box The GOP can say what they want because the majority of its voting base in the US seems to agree with its racist ideology In fact , racism is the biggest card that the Republican party has in this game , and it's a Trump card As grim as this scenario sounds , it actually gives me some hope It seems racism is on the rise But today , the black community is mobilised in a way not seen since - or even during - the Civil Rights Movement Black voters are vocal in the streets and on social media , and are increasingly demanding that Democrats "" earn this damn vote or lose it "" Gone are the days of being assured of the black vote while supporting policies that destroy black communities Black and Hispanic people are increasingly taking roles in government while white population numbers are dwindling Even the acceptance of white norms are unabashedly fought by entertainers such as Nicki Minaj and Kanye West The world is changing , white supremacy is under threat ""I'm not just talking about skinheads , I'm talking about the implicit white supremacy that allows the media to label white mass murders as "" quiet "" while labelling innocent black murder victims "" the son of drug users "" ""I'm talking about the white supremacy that created the war on drugs that disproportionately convicts black and Hispanic people for drug use even though white people are more likely to use , abuse , and deal drugs The melting pot has always worked because it's been a cream base with a few extra ingredients But within a generation , white people will be the minority Many people are afraid of this - interestingly , they are often those who would argue that racial inequality is an imagined issue If that's so , why would a white minority be a problem Becoming a minority wouldn't be scary if we honestly believed minorities were treated with equity But we don't believe that , so weapons are being drawn in the battle for white supremacy's reign I think the violence and rhetoric is from people who realise the party's over - not tomorrow , we still have work to do , but better days are coming ""There's a manic kind of violence in today's white supremacy - whether it's in the Chicago police department , Fox media , or Dylann Roof White supremacy is a cornered rat that sees its own mortality and wants to cause as much damage as possible on its way to the grave But this mania is countered by a confident strength in our minority communities Black women are standing topless in the streets with their fists in the air Hispanic communities are unapologetically flexing their political power Even Muslims - who are taking this racist xenophobia on the chin - are refusing to feel guilty and asking why everyday Christians don't feel the need to apologise for Christian ' terrorists ' And I'm heartened by the increasing volume in voices of white people , many formerly silent , who are saying , "" We can do better than this . White supremacy has had its run , but it will fight in increasingly violent displays as it's dying Trump and the rest of the GOP contenders know this and want to capitalise on it They are stoking fear of a changing world to their advantage They don't care about their voter base They don't care about the next generation , or even really about this one They care only about winning the election , and they're willing to crank up the heat and burn us all to do it "
0,"The discipline of Islamic archaeology may be less familiar to members of the Oriental Institute , which describes itself as devoted to the art and archaeology of the ancient Near East Research in this period began with the first field projects in the 1930s , tangential to work at Alishar Tepe , the Amuq , Nippur , and Medinet Habu ( Jeme ) , and the special focus of later projects as E . F . work at Rayy and Istakhr and Robert McC Adams work in the Diyala , Abu Sarifa , and Jundi Shapur These projects contributed Islamic artifacts to the museum's large holdings of Arabic papyri , bookbindings , and tombstones , originally on display in Breasted's "" Persian and Islamic Hall . Building on this tradition , the Oriental Institute has supported Islamic field projects at Quseir al-Qadim , Luxor , Aqaba , and most recently Hadir Qinnasrin , with a growing number of students benefiting from these opportunities to specialize in this relatively new field One of the most enduring ideas of Breasted is the concept of the "" Fertile Crescent . Aqaba lies at a pivotal juncture along this zone of incipient civilization This site has made major contributions toward understanding the formative period of Islamic civilization in the seventh century The city plan and artifacts testify to the gradual transformation from late Byzantine into early Islamic styles This parallels the emergence of Islamic political and cultural identity in the time of the first caliphs and the Umayyad dynasty This is the beginning of a new age and not the end of antiquity , as more often depicted here in the Oriental Institute The emergence of Islamic civilization , which is no clearer than the emergence of the Sumerians or the Old Kingdom , demands the attentions of archaeological research Islamic archaeology presents a prime opportunity to address historical questions from complementary textual and archaeological evidence In early November , Alka Patel , University of Michigan , organized an Interdisciplinary Workshop entitled , "" Communities and Commodities : Western India and the Indian Ocean ( 11th – 15th Centuries ) . This provided an opportunity to present the resist-dyed textiles recovered in the Quseir al-Qadim excavations The research of Ruth Barnes on the block-printed textiles from western India , located in the Kelsey museum ( 1993 ) , is paralleled by a closely similar collection in the Oriental Institute More importantly , this excavated corpus provides the first and largest body of evidence , closely datable and with architectural ( and thus social ) contexts There is some irony that the Quseir textiles are becoming the most important , or at least best known , result of these excavations A corpus of documents and textiles from one residence , called the Sheikh's house , may be narrowly dated to the first half of the thirteenth century This artifactual assemblage features a wide range of ceramics , glass , coins , and evidence of foodstuffs , both used and stored in the residence and warehouse Recent studies of the Quseir letters by Li Guo ( in Journal of Near Eastern Studies 1999 , 2001 ) begin the description of the family of Sheikh Abu Mufarrij , who participated in the "" kinship network "" that was part of a Muslim commercial hegemony This combination of artifacts and documentation allows an extremely detailed examination of this trading community , its relationship with the Geniza and archaeology of Fustat , and its role in the larger picture of Indian Ocean history A preliminary article on the interrelationship of architectural context , artifacts , and documentation was written by the author with Katherine Strange Burke ( doctoral candidate in the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations [ NELC ] ) , who will pursue the details of this subject in her dissertation Archaeological research has brought to light the early Islamic city of Ayla in the heart of the modern city of Aqaba This archaeological site was occupied during a pivotal historical period ( from ca A D 650 to about A D 1100 ) The broader occupation pattern at Aqaba was a sequence of settlements , generally moving from northwest to the southeast The early phases of archaeological research at Aqaba tended to focus on its foundation , on the potential significance of one of the earliest Islamic cities as a key to understanding the beginnings of this advance in urbanism More recently , interest has shifted to the collapse of this city , or perhaps better , the causes of change to the newer settlement around the castle The latest events in the early Islamic port may be bracketed by the visit of the great geographer al-Muqaddasi ( ca 985 ) , when he discerned the last phase of its early Islamic prosperity This literary account may be contrasted with the archaeological evidence of massive destruction , the results of the earthquake of 1068 , which sealed the fate of this settlement at a time when the shores of the Red Sea were dominated by the Fatimid dynasty of Egypt This environment was one of political and economic instability , graphically demonstrated in the hoard of dinars from Sijilmasa , perhaps lost during the bedouin sack of the town in 1024 The events of the millennium are an opportune moment to seek new historical understandings from archaeology When the site of early Islamic Ayla was abandoned in the early twelfth century , settlement shifted to the castle , known now as Aqaba castle This fortified structure is located about one kilometer southeast at the mouth of the Wadi Shalala ; the structure may be Crusader or , more likely , Ayyubid in origin The present remains are mostly Mamluk and Ottoman The author has argued that the castle and its surrounding settlement was called Aqabat Ayla in the medieval period This name persisted until the fourteenth century , when the ruins of Ayla were no longer extant , and the name contracted to Aqaba The modern city of Aqaba expanded from this village around the castle only in the last few decades While settlement in this region had certainly declined from the early Islamic urban center of Ayla , a continuity of human occupation was guaranteed in the constants of abundant freshwater , agricultural , and marine resources , combined with the economic incentive of seasonal activity provisioning pilgrims The study of this castle has begun with two seasons in 2000 and 2001 , under the direction of Johnny De Meulemeester , Denys Pringle , and Sawsan al-Fakhri A larger season , with the participation of several NELC students , was postponed due to the recent conflict in the Gulf One hopes that the larger settlement history , a splendid example of the utilization of archaeological and documentary resources in a regional context , will continue to amplify the discoveries in early Islamic Ayla This small site is well known as Beth Yerah , an important early Bronze Age settlement on the southern shore of Lake Tiberias The Oriental Institute's involvement in this site began in 1952  1953 , when Pinhas Delougaz and Richard C . Haines excavated a Byzantine church beneath an "" Arab building . Last year's Annual Report presented the startling discovery that this building was part of an early Islamic settlement called Sinnabra A preliminary article outlining this analysis appeared in al-Usur al-Wusta 14.1 More recently , the Israeli archaeologist , Rafael Greenberg , has returned to Khirbet al - Karak for new excavations He reports much new information about the Islamic materials , as well as additional records in the stores of the Israel Antiquity Authority Closer to home ( in the Oriental Institute storerooms ) , NELC student Gabrielle Novacek has begun systematically examining the Bronze Age collections from this site ; she reports finding more Islamic materials in this search One hopes that a cooperative project may be possible at this multi-period site in the near future Last February , Robert McC Adams and many other archaeologists who worked in Khuzestan many years ago gathered for a Landscape Archaeology workshop in the Oriental Institute I presented a paper praising Adams's contribution to Islamic archaeology in Iraq and Iran and followed this with the display of a small collection of ceramics from Jundi Shapur In 1963 , Adams turned his attention briefly from the long history of development of settlement and agricultural infrastructure in the Mesopotamian alluvium toward the adjacent region of Khuzestan in south-western Iran In one campaign , he mapped and excavated soundings on a city founded by Shapur I in the mid-third century The site was located not far from the Oriental Institute excavations at Chogha Mish Adams recorded the formidable ruins of Jundi Shapur , extending some 3.0 km by 1.5 km and laid out in an orthogonal fashion described as a chess board some seven hundred years later The brief excavations conducted by Adams at Jundi Shapur were too limited to reveal Sasanian monuments and communities , especially its medical school and Chris - tian churches Likewise , the continuations of the medical school and astronomical observatory , and social interactions within the early Islamic city , could not be located and these social achievements were denigrated as a long cultural decline Last year , Abbas Alizadeh and Nick Kouchoukos began a program to return to Khuzestan on behalf of the Oriental Institute to continue the study of ancient settlements and irrigation systems Abbas has prepared a solid foundation for this renewed investigation in his efforts to publish Kantor's work at Chogha Mish and ( soon ) Chogha Bonut , as well as his own archaeological research there Like Adams before them , interest in the great Sasanian irrigation schemes lead naturally to the immense city of Jundi Shapur In the spring season of research in Khuzestan , I hope to visit Iran and explore the possibility of resuming archaeological investigation at Jundi Shapur As part of these preparations , the Jundi Shapur sherds have been thoroughly studied They proved interesting enough , colored glazes are always pleasant to handle , that they became teaching tools for a ceramics class that I taught this spring A fine ceramic spout in the shape of a bull's head , a symbol of the potential interests of this Sasanian and early Islamic city , will be featured in News & Notes , Fall 2003 , No 179 The International Congress on the Archaeology of the Ancient Near East ( ICAANE ; at Copenhagen and Paris ) provided two stimulating experiences in workshops on Islamic archaeology These meetings resulted in the agreement by the participants that this discipline needs to find "" a continuous platform for international meetings in our field . This sentiment was voiced by Dr . Claus-Peter Haase , Director of the Museum for Islamic Art in Berlin , who organized a Symposium on the Archaeology of the Islamic Periods held in Berlin on November 16 – 18 This forum presented an amazing range of important , recent discoveries in Islamic archaeology A more important reason for this gathering was to discuss the future of this quickly expanding field of research As continuing association with ICAANE seems difficult , the symposium noted that a critical level in numbers and vigor of exchange seems to warrant the foundation of a separate organization Alastair Northedge summarized this situation , which led to informal discussion throughout the symposium Claus drew together a preliminary "" steering committee , "" composed of himself , Jeremy Johns , Alan Walmsley , and myself to discuss a new organization , tentatively entitled the Association of Islamic Archaeologists The aim is , as Claus put it , an institution which may offer a "" better coherency of studies and presentations ... and interchange with the colleagues in the Near and Middle East . This symposium had , of necessity , a restricted number of international participants and all were aware of a need for more inclusive future deliberations This may be effectively achieved through the Internet ; several proposals were entertained on accomplishing this , but with no immediate conclusion The initial description of this field as the Archaeology of Islamic Periods reflected some concern with misinterpretation of the idea of "" Islamic Archaeology . Following the lead of Northedge's 1999 formulation , this term should be seen not as religious but cultural ; the subject matter encompasses historic cultures under Islamic political hegemonies within which linguistic , material , and religious aspects may be present While the focus should be on the "" central Islamic lands , "" this field includes regions affected by Islam , whether in the Mediterranean , Asia , or Africa Likewise , antecedent and parallel cultural traditions must be considered Finally , the growing field of Ottoman archaeology must be included within Islamic archaeology There needs to be recognition that the discipline of Islamic Art History is closely interrelated but has distinctive methodologies and theoretical concerns More importantly , there is a common focus on the relationship with history and allied philological disciplines that must be clearly formulated In sum , the field of Islamic Archaeology must address fundamental definitions to be recognized as an independent academic discipline Islamic Archaeology needs to be more than what archaeologists of medieval periods do in Islamic lands "
0,"""Ali's record as Caliph is incomplete , to say the least He reigned for a mere 5 years , and most of that time was occupied by answering the many direct challenges that were made to his rule This circumstance also makes it incredibly difficult to pull apart the historical account of Ali's reign , all of which were written over a century after the fact and reflect the more hardened sectarian identities that had developed by then He declared that he was devoted to purging the community of dissension and corruption , and to this end he replaced the provincial governors who had been appointed by Umar and Uthman and instituted an even distribution of taxes and booty throughout the empire , ending the practice of regional governors collecting and distributing revenue in their own provinces ( he seems to have done this against the advice of his closest advisors , who counseled him not to make any drastic changes ) Tellingly , Muʿawiyah simply ignored Ali's message dismissing him from his post , the only provincial governor to do so.The flattening and equalizing of the tax and booty won him considerable support from the non-Qurayshi elements of the empire , particularly the Ansar , the people of Medina who had originally invited Muhammad to relocate there from Mecca , and non-Arabs or mawali You see , despite the egalitarianism that seemed embedded in the fabric of the Quran and was a core part of Muhammad's appeal to new followers , a clearly tiered society was beginning to emerge , with those who had come from Mecca ( even if they or their clan had originally opposed Muhammad and participated in the war against Medina ) on top and everybody else looking up at them to one degree or another The ansar , who had invited Muhammad in , protected him , and loyally followed him , were especially aggrieved to see those Meccans who had tried to quash Muhammad's movement by force rise above them to positions of higher power and greater wealth But nobody had it worse than the non-Arabs , the mawali ( the word expresses a sort of kinship relation with someone ) There is nothing inherent to the Quran or in Muhammad's life that suggests he intended his movement to be an Arabs-only affair ( indeed , one of his most prominent and beloved early followers was a man named "" Salman the Persian "" ) , but because it grew out of Arabian tribal society it was challenging to incorporate converts into the community who came from outside the tribal system The mawali had to be "" adopted "" by a tribe in order to become part of the community , which meant acquiring an Arab patron or sponsor , which ultimately meant that they were subordinated to the Arabs even though that was never supposed to be the case They were excluded from political and military authority and were at a disadvantage to the Arabs , particularly the Quraysh , in almost every imaginable way The irony that Muhammad and his followers were themselves effectively outside the Arabian tribal order when they fled Mecca ( indeed , that's more or less why they had to flee ) was apparently unnoticed Ali , or at least the Ali who has been portrayed down through the centuries , was going to end the preferential treatment of the Quraysh , and Arabs in general , and unlock the true egalitarianism of Muhammad's message , but his assassination stopped that project in its tracks Part of the enduring power of Shi ʿism derives from its appeal to the traditionally disaffected fringes of Islamic society and the promise of equality that was contained in Ali's political philosophy ""Ali's accession laid these kinds of simmering factional hostilities out in the open by beginning to upend the established order , but it also inflamed a very new kind of factional tension for the Arabs , one based on imperial geography rather than on tribe or clan Ali elected to move his capital to the new military garrison town of Kufa , in Iraq , because he had strong support there ( among some of the people who had participated in Uthman's assassination , it should be noted ) and also because it was closer to the Empire's military frontiers than Medina But if you go way back to the days before Muhammad , you'll recall that Iraq lay on the Persian side of the Persian  Roman border , and Ali's decision to move there did not sit well with those , Arab and otherwise , who had been living in Syria and had been on the Roman side of that particular conflict Now remember that Muʿawiyah , Uthman's kinsman and the one regional governor who openly resisted Ali's command that he step down , was the governor of Syria , and you can maybe see where this is headed Because of the civil strife , Ali's reign really saw the empire shrink from the size it had reached under Uthman ; much of North Africa ( a good portion of which was ruled by vassals and not yet under direct Caliphal control ) and some frontier territory in eastern Iran  Central Asia was lost as Ali's attention was focused on suppressing internal revolt The first blow to be struck happened at The Battle of the Camel , in November 656 near Basra , when Ali's army defeated a rebellion led by Muhammad's widow , Aisha b . Abi Bakr , and the two men who had been considered for the accession along with Ali , Talhah and al-Zubayr They were demanding that Ali arrest and prosecute ( execute ) Uthman's murderers , but it's not clear that he was powerful enough to do that to the people who had put him in power and it's also not clear that Aisha , Talhah , and al-Zubayr would have actually been satisfied if he'd done so Talhah and al-Zubayr both died in the fighting ( Talhah supposedly shot down by one of his own men , Marwan b . al-Hakam , who we will definitely see again , when he decided to leave the field rather than fight fellow Muslims ) , and Aisha was allowed a dignified retirement from state affairs in Medina The battle takes its name from the camel ridden by Aisha , which became the focal point of the fighting What makes the Battle of the Camel so momentous is not simply that it was the first battle in a much wider war , but that it was definitively the first case of Muslim fighting Muslim ; the Ridda Wars had pitted Muhammad's followers against those who had stopped supporting the movement after he died , but the latter were not "" Muslim "" ( to the extent that "" Muslim "" was a defined group at this point ) because they'd only pledged their support to Muhammad , not to his message or the movement in general From the histories it seems as though neither side had a real desire to fight this battle ; in fact , they seem to have reached a tentative agreement to avoid combat until the group known at the time as the Qurra , who were this sort of berserker corps in the Arab armies , known for fighting hard and passionately but also uncontrollably , launched a night attack against Aisha's army The Qurra were culpable in Uthman's assassination and had supported Ali's accession , but they feared that if a settlement were reached between the two sides that Ali's attention would then fall on them as regicides So they precipitated the battle to save their own hides Now that the floodgates of civil war had opened , the battle was joined in earnest between the two most imposing figures in the Islamic World at the time : Ali , the Caliph , versus Muʿawiyah , the renegade governor of Syria This period is known as the First Fitna , from the Arabic word fitnah suggesting upheaval , chaos , and possibly secession ; i . e . , a civil war Muʿawiyah was supported by another important figure , Amr b . al - ʿAs , who had led the conquest of Egypt ; this brought Egypt into Muʿawiyah ' s orbit as well Muʿawiyah was ostensibly fighting for the same reason Aisha had claimed , a desire to see the killers of his kinsman Uthman brought to justice and anger that Ali had not done so , but his actions indicate someone who was really fighting in the service of his greater ambitions As at the Battle of the Camel , both sides initially pursued a negotiated settlement , but Muʿawiyah ' s intransigence and his refusal to accept Ali's accession seemed to invite battle The Battle of Siffin in July 657 was technically a lopsided victory for Ali , who according to the sources suffered roughly half the casualties that Muʿawiyah did , but it ended when Muʿawiyah ' s soldiers marched onto the field bearing copies of the Quran ( or perhaps scrolls with Quranic verses written on them ) and demanding that Ali submit to arbitration over Muʿawiyah ' s grievances Ali was in a bit of a bind here ; he couldn't very well press the attack without looking like the aggressor , which would make him look less than righteous , and his appeal rested on the fact that he was the righteous legitimate caliph and Muʿawiyah was in the wrong for his refusal to recognize that fact So he agreed to the arbitration The arbitrators , one from Muʿawiyah ' s side and one from Ali's , inexplicably agreed on what Muʿawiyah wanted : that Ali should be stripped of the Caliphate and the office thrown open to election by the people Ali absolutely rejected this ruling and thus broke his agreement to abide by the outcome of the arbitration , and his coalition splintered ""It's hard not to assume that this was Muʿawiyah ' s intention all along in pursuing the arbitration , and it worked perfectly The Qurra , who had dictated Ali's choice of arbitrator , promptly abandoned him for even agreeing to arbitration in the first place , refusing to fight in what they argued was a just cause The Qurra were from then on known as the Khawarij , the plural of kharij , which means "" one who goes out "" or "" one who leaves . Modern scholarship also refers to them as "" Kharijites "" Ali was now spending his time fighting against his former allies , particularly the Kharijites , while Muʿawiyah ' s armies methodically expanded the territory under his control into Iraq and Arabia , as far south as Yemen In January 661 , his Caliphate collapsing around him , Ali was himself assassinated by a group of Kharijites while at prayer in Kufa The office of Caliph now fell to the only man who could claim it , Muʿawiyah , but no caliph would ever again rule over a united Islamic polity Next time : Muʿawiyah , the Umayyads , and the meet the Second Fitna , same as the First Further Reading : Wilferd Madelung's The Succession to Muhammad : A Study of the Early Caliphate lays out the case that Muhammad intended for Ali to succeed him all along , maybe a little too well since it seems like Madelung is engaging in persuasion rather than simple academic study If you can filter out his biases , though , it's indispensable Works on the history and development of Shi ʿism , like Heinz Halm's aptly titled Shi ʿism or Husain Jafri's The Origins and Early Development of Shi ʿa Islam , are worth reading but keep in mind that Shi ʿism is still in its very , very developmental stages here Hell , Islam is still in its very developmental stages at this point Suliman Bashear's Arabs and Others in Early Islam talks about the problem of assimilating non-Arabs into the Empire in the early centuries Hugh Kennedy's The Prophet and the Age of the Caliphates , 600 – 1050 , his The Great Arab Conquests : How the Spread of Islam Changed the World We Live in , and his The Armies of the Caliphs : military and society in the early Islamic State Patricia Crone's God's Caliph : Religious Authority in the First Centuries of Islam As always , The Cambridge History of Islam and The New Cambridge History of Islam ( also volume 4 of The Cambridge History of Iran ) are worthwhile if you're really looking to immerse yourself , but they're not for the casual reader "

A jury on Friday found Junead Khan guilty of preparing an act of terrorism The 25 - year-old's work for a pharmaceutical firm took him past U . S . air bases in eastern England Prosecutors said Khan , who was arrested in July , had exchanged online messages with an Islamic State of Iraq and Syria ( ISIS ) fighter in Syria They discussed attacking military personnel after faking a road accident When police raided Khan's home , they found an ISIS-style black flag and a laptop containing an article from an al Qaeda magazine entitled "" Make a bomb in the kitchen of your mom . CBS News partner network Sky News said Khan allegedly came up with the plan after driving past the RAF Mildenhall and RAF Lakenheath military bases in Suffolk , where some U . S . personnel are based He had allegedly planned to fake a car crash and then use a knife to attack any American personnel who came to his aid Prosecutors said during the trial that he had used his job as a driver for a pharmaceutical company as cover to conduct surveillance on United States Air Force installations in Suffolk Metropolitan Police Counter Terrorism Commander Dean Haydon said Khan "" posed a real risk to public safety , "" according to Sky News "" He'd undertaken research and planning to make a pressure cooker bomb ... And , what we think is , either before or during the attack , if he'd been compromised in any way he was going to detonate that device and commit suicide , "" Haydon said The details of the alleged plot harked back to the brutal slaying by two Islamic extremists of a British soldier on the streets of southeast London The two British men , who considered themselves "" soldiers of Allah , "" were convicted of murdering Fusilier Lee Rigby , who was run down with a car and stabbed to death in the frenzied May 2013 attack The jury of eight women and four men deliberated for just 90 minutes before finding Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale guilty of murdering Khan and his 23 - year-old uncle Shazib Khan were also convicted at Kingston Crown Court of preparing to join ISIS militants in Syria "
0,"President Barack Obama hailed the nuclear deal with Iran on Friday as a "" substantial success "" and a model for future diplomacy , as world leaders took stock of the world's most worrisome nuclear threats Hosting his last nuclear security summit , Obama sought to use the controversial Iran deal as an argument for his carrot-and-stick approach to deterring nuclear proliferation , and he credited Iran with taking steps to meet its commitments Critics of the deal in the U . S . and abroad are livid about the sanctions relief Iran is receiving in response "" It will take time for Iran to reintegrate in the global economy , but Iran is already beginning to see the benefits of this deal , "" Obama said as he met with the leaders of China , France and other U . N . Security Council members that negotiated the Iran deal alongside the U . S . Obama acknowledged that the nuclear deal hasn't swept away other issues the U . S . and other nations still have with Iran ; support for terrorism and Tehran's ballistic missile program typically top that list Still , he said all the nations that negotiated the deal could agree that it's been an effective way to address the narrower issue of nuclear proliferation in Iran "" This is a success of diplomacy that hopefully we will be able to copy in the future , "" Obama said In an effort to increase transparency worldwide , the president also announced at Friday's opening of the nuclear summit that the U . S . would release , for the first time , a public inventory of its nuclear stockpile The U . S . military would also announce steps it is taking to protect nuclear weapons and materials The huddle on the sidelines of the nuclear summit started off the final day on an optimistic note , as Obama worked to illustrate that progress has been made on his watch on stopping the spread of nuclear weapons Yet the dozens of world leaders assembled were equally focused on other threats that have only increased in recent years , such as the harrowing prospect of the Islamic State group or other extremists getting their hands on a nuclear bomb.At Friday's opening session , Mr . Obama stated that while the world has "" measurably reduced the risk "" of terrorists gaining nuclear weapons , "" the threat of nuclear terrorism persists . "" No terrorist group has succeeded thus far in obtaining a nuclear weapon or a dirty bomb made of radioactive materials , "" the president said "" But we know that al-Qaeda has long sought nuclear materials ... ISIL has already used chemical weapons including mustard gas in Syria and Iraq There is no doubt that if these mad men ever got their hands on a nuclear bomb or nuclear material , they most certainly would use it to kill as many innocent people as possible And that's why our work here remains so critical . Frustration over the slow pace of reducing nuclear stockpiles has shadowed this year's summit , Obama's last major push on denuclearization The absence of key players - especially Russia - further underscored the lack of unanimity still confronting global efforts to deter nuclear attacks After six years of prodding by Obama and others before him , the global stockpile of fissile material that could be used in nuclear bombs remains in the thousands of metric tons ""What's more , security officials warn that the radioactive ingredients for a "" dirty bomb "" are alarmingly insecure in many parts of the globe Ahead of the summit , fewer than half of the countries participating had agreed to secure their sources of radiological material , readily available in hospital , industrial and academic settings Concerns about substances like cesium or cobalt getting in the wrong hands have escalated sharply following deadly attacks by IS , raising the disturbing prospect of a nuclear attack on a Western city As the summit opened Thursday , leaders trained their focus on North Korea , whose continued provocations have stoked concerns throughout the region Obama discussed steps to deter further North Korean missile tests during a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping In another session with the leaders of Japan and South Korea , he called for vigorous implementation of stepped-up U . N . sanctions President Vladimir Putin of Russia , whose massive nuclear weapons stockpile is rivaled only by the U . S . , refused to attend this year's summit Moscow scoffed at what it deemed U .

S . helicopters ferrying elite counter-terrorism troops into the compound identified by the CIA as bin Laden's hideout - - and back out again in less than 40 minutes Bin Laden was shot in the head , officials said , after he and his bodyguards resisted the assault Three adult males were also killed in the raid , including one of bin Laden's sons , whom officials did not name One of bin Laden's sons , Hamza , is a senior member of al Qaeda U .

S . official who disclosed the burial at sea said it would have been difficult to find a country willing to accept the remains Mr . Obama said the remains had been handled in accordance with Islamic custom , which requires speedy burial "" I heard a thundering sound , followed by heavy firing Then firing suddenly stopped Then more thundering , then a big blast , "" said Mohammad Haroon Rasheed , a resident of Abbottobad , Pakistan , after the choppers had swooped in and then out again Bin Laden's death marks a psychological triumph in a long struggle that began with the Sept . 11 attacks , and seems certain to give Mr . Obama a political lift But its ultimate impact on al Qaeda is less clear The greatest terrorist threat to the U . S . is now considered to be the al Qaeda franchise in Yemen , far from al Qaeda's core in Pakistan The Yemen branch almost took down a U . S . - bound airliner on Christmas 2009 and nearly detonated explosives aboard two U . S . cargo planes last fall Those operations were carried out without any direct involvement from bin Laden Moments after Mr . Obama spoke , the State Department put U .

S . official said inside information was key to the successful operation Detainees and cooperation from foreign authorities were crucial in providing information that led to his capture Based on statements given by U . S . detainees since the 9 attacks , officials said , intelligence officials have long known that bin Laden trusted one al Qaeda courier in particular , and they believed he might be living with him in hiding CBS News was told that the courier was "" trusted "" by bin Laden "" We identified areas where this courier and his brother operated , but they had extensive operational security , "" said the official - - and those elaborate security procedures made the U .

Obama wanted to "" pursue an aggressive course of action , "" a senior administration official said The president spent part of his Sunday on the golf course , but cut his round short to return to the White House for a meeting where he and top national security aides reviewed final preparations for the raid Two hours later , Mr . Obama was told that bin Laden had been tentatively identified CIA director Leon Panetta was directly in charge of the military team during the operation , according to one official , and when he and his aides received word at agency headquarters that bin Laden had been killed , cheers broke out around the conference room table Administration aides said the operation was so secretive that no foreign officials were informed in advance , and only a small circle inside the U . S . government was aware of what was unfolding half a world away In his announcement , Mr . Obama said he had called Pakistani President Zardari after the raid , and said it was "" important to note that our counter-terrorism cooperation with Pakistan helped lead us to bin Laden and the compound where he was hiding . One senior administration told reporters , though , "" we were very concerned ... that he was inside Pakistan , but this is something we're going to continue to work with the Pakistani government on .

0,"Islamic extremism is driven by a totalitarian interpretation of Islam that believes in a global Islamic state What is Islamic Extremism Islamic extremism is driven by an interpretation of Islam that believes that Islamic law , or sharia , is an all-encompassing religious-political system Since it is believed to be proscribed by Allah ( Arabic for "" God "" ) sharia must be enforced in the public sphere by a global Islamic state As such , Islamic extremists consider it to be the only truly legitimate form of governance and reject democracy and human rights values Thus , the ultimate objective of Islamic extremists is the merger of "" mosque and state "" under sharia law Those who favor such an approach are called Islamists Their ideology is called Islamism , or political Islam Related terms for Islamic extremism include radical Islam and Islamic supremacy Islamic extremists believe they are obligated to install this form of governance in Muslim-majority territories , countries and , eventually , the entire world In the minds of Islamic extremists , they are promoting justice and freedom by instituting sharia In some cases , Islamic extremists even describe sharia as a superior form of "" democracy . Islamic extremists have intermediate political goals which they believe will pave the way for the global implementation of sharia One of these goals is the removal of non-Muslim military forces from Muslim lands and the overthrow of "" enemy "" regimes Acts of Islamic extremism includes terrorism , human rights abuses , the advancement of sharia-based governance , bigotry towards non-Muslims and rival Muslims and overall hostility to the West and , in particular , Western democracy Why is Islamic extremism in the news Islamic extremism is the primary national security and human rights concern of the world today It is firstly the primary motivator of acts of terrorism worldwide Secondly , as Islamic extremists gain power and rule , human rights abuses – including oppression of women , homosexuals and religious minorities as well as governmental tyranny , sectarian warfare and bigotry inherent in sharia law – come to the fore What is the difference between Islamic extremism and terrorism Not all Islamic extremists carry out violent acts Islamic extremists can advance their goals using non-violent tactics such as activism , developing interfaith coalitions with unsuspecting non-Muslims , fundraising , building political influence and the overall spreading of the ideology These extremists follow a doctrine called gradualism The largest Islamic extremist group to use this method is the Muslim Brotherhood Islamic terrorists , on the other hand , use violence and terrorism to instill fear and to gain political power in order to establish their goals Often times , groups that ascribe to the doctrine of gradualism as their own modus operandi support other Islamic extremist groups involved in terrorism financially , such was the case when a group of Muslim Brotherhood entities in the U . S . were listed as unindicted co-conspirators in the Holy Land Foundation case for financing the Hamas terror organization Is Islamic Extremism Related to Islam Islamic extremism derives from a radical interpretation of Islam Even among Islamic extremists , there are interpretative differences stemming from different sects and  or doctrines ""It's important to note that not all Muslims subscribe to a radical interpretation of Islam Clarion Project regularly interviews moderate Muslims to highlight their viewpoints and their fight against the ideology of Islamic extremists What has caused the rise of Islamic extremism in the world Modern Islamic extremism grew out the Islamic revivalist movement , which began in the late 19th century Islamic revivalism was a response to the perceived weakness of the Muslim world compared to the British empire , as well as the rise of secularism due to the increased influence of the Western values in Muslim countries Thinkers associated with Islamic revivalism preached a fresh interpretation of Islamic texts based on goals of pan-Islamic unity and the establishment of Islamic states based on sharia law How should governments combat with the phenomenon of Islamic extremism One school of thought contends that Islamic extremism is bred by political and societal grievances Thus , this school believes that extremists are provoked by injustices committed by the West and their governments and armies in Muslim countries According to this school , Islamic extremism should be countered by addressing these "" grievances "" of angry Muslim populations through foreign policy changes , political concessions where there are areas of disagreements , improved governance of Muslim countries , income redistribution and dialogue The other school of thought holds that these grievances , bred by Islamic extremists , are just excuses to justify antagonism towards the West This side argues that the Islamic extremist worldview leads to the adoption of these grievances Advocates of this school of thought note that the grievances cannot account for all elements of Islamic extremism , such as the abuse of women and other human rights violations in sharia-based societies According to this school , Islamic extremism can only be countered by undermining the ideology itself Reformist Muslims that support an interpretation of Islam that is favorable to modernity and Western democracy are viewed as critical to fighting Islamic extremists What are some examples of Islamic extremist groups The most popular Islamic extremist group is the Muslim Brotherhood , an international organization that believes in waging jihad through various means in order to establish worldwide sharia rule One of those means is through a process of "" cultural or civilization "" jihad , which follows the Brotherhood's strategy of gradualism There are many political parties ( i . e the Freedom and Justice Party in Egypt ) and terrorist groups ( i . e Hamas ) that belong to the Brotherhood In fact , according to Steve Emerson , the executive director of the highly respected Investigative Project on Terrorism , "" The vast majority of Sunni terrorist groups – including al Qaeda , Egyptian Islamic Jihad , Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad – are derived from the Muslim Brotherhood . Other examples of Islamic extremist groups include Hezbollah , the Taliban , Jamaat-e-Islami , Jamaat ul-Fuqra , Lashkar-e-Taiba , the Nation of Islam and various Salafist groups Who sponsors the spread of Islamic extremism Islamic extremism can spread organically , but there is an identifiable infrastructure that spreads it This infrastructure includes foreign governments , mosques , schools , media – including internet and social media - - social services and non-governmental organizations The U . S . State Department designated four governments as State Sponsors of Terrorism : Iran , Syria , Sudan and Cuba The Iranian government is considered the world's largest sponsor of terrorism in the world The U . S . government has also documented the fact that Iran supports terrorist groups such as Hezbollah , Al-Qaeda , the Taliban , Hamas , Palestinian Islamic Jihad and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command Iran also supports radical militias in Iraq and Yemen and directly participates in acts of terrorism globally The Syrian government supports Hezbollah and is a chief ally of Iran It has historically supported other terrorist groups as well , but that support ended when these other groups endorsed the Syrian rebels trying to overthrow the Syrian government The Sudanese government works closely with Iran and is a well-known supporter of Hamas There are also allegations that Sudan supports Hezbollah and elements of Al Qaeda The Cuban government supports non-Muslim terrorist groups in Latin America and harbors at least one Muslim terrorist wanted by the U . S . government The non-Muslim groups supported by Cuba , specifically the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) , are known to have ties to Hezbollah There are other governments that have not been designated as "" State Sponsors of Terrorism "" but are accused of supporting Islamic terrorist groups or Islamic extremism They include : Pakistan , who is a known sponsor of Islamic terrorists and their religious schools , called madrasses Pakistan is a continual promoter Islamic extremism Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states , who are lavish funders of a virulent form of Islam called "" Wahhabism . This funding has carried on for decades , even while these countries battle some of its adherents like Al-Qaeda Turkey and Qatar , who are major backers of the Muslim Brotherhood movement ; Eritrea , who is a documented sponsor of Islamic extremists including Al-Qaeda's affiliate in Somalia , Al-Shabaab ; and Venezuela , who has been accused of allowing Iranian and Hezbollah operatives to support terrorism from its soil In the West , Islamic extremist groups and their supporters spread their ideology ( and , in some cases , directly sponsor terrorism ) using a network of front groups An example would be the Iranian government's use of the Alavi Foundation in New York or the Muslim Brotherhood's establishment of various political organizations under different names , like CAIR , the Council on American Islamic Relations , one of the U .

But the network extended even further Belgian Foreign Minister Didier Reynders notes that not all radicalized militants in Belgium join the Islamic State in Syria – or even have Syria as their primary target An entire web of "" accomplices "" – whom , until recently , have operated under the radar of police – provided Abdeslam and others like him with weapons and contacts Some work "" freelance "" for the Islamic State , recruiting and planning attacks , while selling drugs or engaging in racketeering on the side to finance their schemes Others concentrate on terror in the homeland But what is becoming clear in the wake of Abdeslam's arrest is the connection between Islamic militants and organized crime At the same time , the pool of recruits for Islamist extremists has widened Counter-terrorism expert Rik Coolsaet notes that whereas in the past , radicalization occurred from religious indoctrination , but today , it is enough to be a secular rebel From there , the jump to Islamist radical is a short one Salah Abdeslam and his brother Brahim , who blew himself up at a Paris caf é the night of November 13 , ran a bar in Molenbeek , popular among young Muslim men in the neighborhood Shortly before the Paris attacks , it was shut down for drug dealing Coolsaet says , "" Joining Islamic State opens a thrilling , bigger-than-life dimension to their way of life For most of them it is akin to street gangs , drug trafficking , juvenile delinquency , "" he said "" A journey to Utopia . As prosecutors note , the complexity of the process of radicalization means that monitoring radical mosques , social media and communications with jihadis in Syria is not enough anymore Police who entered Molenbeek to arrest Abdeslam were met with a barrage of bottles and other projectiles thrown at them As one resident of the neighborhood , who agreed to speak to the press warned about the number of young people radicalized in Molenbeek , said , "" It's not over There are a lot of them .

The controversy also comes less than a week before Wisconsin Republicans vote in the state's primary , a contest both Trump and his rivals have portrayed as pivotal in the road to the GOP presidential nomination ""Trump's initial comments on Wednesday came after a lengthy exchange with MSNBC host Chris Matthews , who pressured the Republican to give a yes or no answer to the question , "" should abortion be punished . "" There has to be some form of punishment , "" Trump said during a televised town hall event "" For the woman ? Matthews asked , to which Trump replied , "" Yes . Trump declined to specify how women should be punished if they underwent an illegal abortion The Republican front-runner also conceded that outlawing the practice would lead some women to seek out abortions illegally "" Well , you go back to a position like they had where they would perhaps go to illegal places , but we have to ban it , "" Trump said during the town hall Trump had previously declined to answer the question about what penalties he would support for women who undergo abortions or doctors who perform them "" I just don't want to talk about that right now , "" Trump said during a news conference January in Iowa "" Everybody knows my views and I think my views are very plain , "" Trump said Throughout his campaign , Trump has faced questions about the authenticity of his position on abortion He said he was "" pro-choice in every respect "" in a 1999 interview , though he said he hated the "" concept of abortion .

Abayas are ankle-length robes and a hijab is a tightly worn scarf that covers the head and neck but not the face It is the most common Islamic head covering Rossignol made the statement about the veils after the interviewer pointed out that some women choose to wear them Veils remain a controversial topic in France The country banned certain kinds of Muslim veils for security reasons in 2011 The law ignited an intense debate around a woman's right to wear a veil and critics argued it was discriminatory The issue was brought before the European Court of Human Rights , which ruled in favor of the ban in 2014 Rossignol said : "" It cannot be normal that a brand invests in this market and , in the end , puts Muslim women in a situation where they are forced to wear those ( items ) "" We say fashion brands praise the skinny image with anorexic models , which is dangerous for the health of young women We can as well say those same brands , with such Islamic collections , give an image of women that is dangerous for the rights and freedom of Muslim women in France .

"" The Australian Dream We sing of it , and we recite it in verse , "" Grant said , quoting a portion of the Australian anthem : "" Australians all , let us rejoice for we are young and free .

0,"The attacks Tuesday morning on the airport and a subway station in Brussels were highly probable , and at the same time almost impossible to disrupt That oxymoron is what makes this wave of terrorism the most dangerous in history , and so different from even the days of al Qaeda As I wrote last week , the arrest on Friday of Paris terrorism suspect Salah Abdeslam was never going to be the end of the fight Indeed , it could possibly be the beginning of a new wave from ISIS Because Abdeslam was captured alive , European authorities were likely going to be able to get him to speak and perhaps reveal details about the network that had aided him in the Paris attacks last year and that let him remain in hiding for months after And even absent any willingness to speak on his part , Belgian officials would have been more than willing to make it appear as if he were cooperating Indeed , as early as last weekend , Belgian officials were saying that Abdeslam was "" collaborating , "" a word that makes it sound like he was more than happy to turn over information Those in his network , or those who support ISIS , were likely to feel the pressure and launch attacks if they had the opportunity So why , many are asking , wasn't Brussels ready for another attack Basically , no country is ever completely ready Security has three fundamental attributes in any open society : minimizing risk , maximizing defenses , and maintaining freedom Officials minimize the risk by sharing intelligence , infiltrating terrorist groups and trying to disrupt them They maximize defenses by deploying more police and counterterrorism officials , managing borders , and hardening targets as much as practicable The challenge is always the third variable Open societies that rely on the flow of people and goods , that are plugged into the global market and engaged with the world , can't possibly harden every place where people gather As a result , they are constantly balancing the need for counterterrorism efforts against the freedom of movement This is true even for airports , which are essentially porous until you get to the security check They are places where people congregate ; there are stores and restaurants where people meet and relax Departure areas such as the one at Zaventem airport in Brussels are meant to allow people to move quickly so that passengers on their way to flights can check their luggage and head to security , allowing for the next batch of people In the United States alone , about 2 million people travel each day in and out of our airports Our system of commerce and travel would come to a standstill if we essentially pushed out security to the highways outside an airport The same holds for the metropolitan transit systems Yes , they can be made safer with security checks of passengers , but a 20 - minute train ride would then become an hour or more And the public , despite the threat of attacks , would simply not tolerate this The focus on airplane security that we have seen since 9 was of course aimed at ensuring that the airplane itself was not utilized as a weapon of mass destruction But an airport does not have the same luxury , not if countries want and need to maintain their commitment to movement That is why the only option for Brussels right now is the exact opposite : a total shutdown of the airport ""It's like an on  off switch , with little room in between The reality is that there are just too many soft targets in Europe and the United States to ensure complete security It is the way our system of freedom has been built Sadly , as the attacks Tuesday showed , that is also why it is so vulnerable "
0,"Did I move to Indiana My mailing address still says Atlanta , GA , and I just filed my Georgia state income taxes So why do I feel like I'm in Indiana Because the Georgia General Assembly just passed a religious freedom bill , just like Indiana did around this time last year That bill has cost Indiana at least $ 60 million in tourist revenue Unfortunately , what the Georgia legislature passed is worse than Indiana's The bill , if signed into law , could have significant economic consequences for Atlanta The NFL has made clear that Atlanta's potential hosting of the Super Bowl is at risk Many Atlanta-based companies , such as Home Depot and Coca-Cola , have spoken out against the measure Walt Disney is threatening to no longer film movies in the state As a big convention city , Atlanta stands to lose even more revenue The Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce opposes the bill Fortunately , there is still time for Georgia Gov Nathan Deal to veto the measure Supporters of the bill adamantly state the bill is not about discrimination That is just pretext : This bill , along with others in states across the country , are precisely designed to discriminate against lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender ( LGBT ) persons All of the hand-waving cannot deny that fact The bill , called the "" Free Exercise Protection Act , "" ensures that pastors can't be forced to perform same-sex marriages and that no one can be forced to attend one , likely seeking to protect photographers and the like Most important , it allows faith-based organizations to refuse to hire , to fire , or to refuse services if doing so violates their faith So , LGBT persons can be denied services from such organizations , even ones that receive taxpayer money A homeless trans adolescent would like to stay at a faith-based shelter ""They'd have every right to turn them away This goes even further than the Indiana law did The Indiana law permits the burdening of the exercise of religion if the law is narrowly tailored to advance a compelling government interest There is no balancing with the Georgia bill Most telling is the provision noting that the bill should not be construed to "" [ p ] ermit invidious discrimination on any grounds prohibited by federal or state law . This has no legal impact State law can't trump federal law , so that reference has no teeth Federal law would govern even without that language Georgia also has no state-level discrimination prohibitions at all So , those words are meaningless Conspicuously absent from that provision - - showing the act's true intent - - are local ordinances This act would preempt laws like those in Atlanta that provide nondiscrimination protections for the LGBT persons While it is quite legal to fire someone for being gay across most of the state , some cities like Atlanta prohibit such discrimination But , under this law , faith-based organizations in Atlanta could fire someone for being LGBT Confirming this discriminatory intent is what happened last year when the Georgia legislature considered a different religious liberties bill When that bill was amended to ensure that the law did not trump local nondiscrimination ordinances , the sponsor of the bill , State Sen . Josh McKoon , withdrew his support , noting that the change would gut the bill If ensuring nondiscrimination guts the bill , then the bill is truly about discrimination Indeed , we need look no further than Indiana to see this reality There , legislators supposedly fixed the bill to ensure that nondiscrimination ordinances were protected Nevertheless , the lawsuits have begun challenging whether Indianapolis ' and other cities ' protections for the LGBT community must give way to the religious liberty bill If we really want to see what is motivating the legislators of various states , we need only look to North Carolina This week , in a rapid-fire special session , the North Carolina General Assembly adopted a law that eliminates all local ordinances prohibiting LGBT discrimination The North Carolina law sets a uniform definition of what constitutes illegal discrimination and bans local municipalities from deviating from that definition Sexual orientation and gender identity , of course , are not included The result : ordinances in cities like Charlotte , protecting LGBT persons from discrimination , are gone No religious belief is needed there - - everyone is free to fire someone simply because they are LGBT It is far more pernicious than the Georgia bill It is far from clear whether the North Carolina law is constitutional In Romer v . Evans , the U . S . Supreme Court struck down as unconstitutional a Colorado constitutional amendment prohibiting local municipalities from affording nondiscrimination protections to the LGBT community Undoubtedly there will be protracted litigation on this law Both Georgia and North Carolina have marketed themselves as being good for business Indiana apparently was not a big enough canary in the coal mine There is now proof that these types of laws have negative economic consequences for these supposedly pro-business states , which the legislatures ignored Fortunately , I don't live in Indiana or North Carolina I live in Georgia , and the bill is not yet law ""Let's hope that Governor Deal chooses a legacy of inclusion , not exclusion , and vetoes this bill "

For Aust , whose father and uncle both work in law enforcement , the news stories she's seen about unarmed African-American men being shot by police have hit home The officers should be held accountable , she says "" What's not helping is the police are getting off with a slap on the wrist ... If it was me , and I was black , and this was happening in my community , I would be furious , "" she says The case of Walter Scott , who was shot in April by an officer in North Charleston , South Carolina , sticks out in her mind The trial hasn't started yet The officer's attorney says he plans to plead not guilty , and that race has nothing to do with the case But Aust has already made up her mind "" I mean , give me a break , he wouldn't have done that if the man was white , and that's the problem , "" she says ""It's gotten worse , not better , since the 2008 election of President Barack Obama , says Ellis Onic The 56 - year-old engineer in Balch Springs , Texas , who's African-American , points to the 2012 shooting death of Trayvon Martin and this year's Charleston church massacre as examples Time and time again , Onic says , the justice system has failed "" The white man has had his way for so long , they don't think of it as racism They think that's just the way it is ... We have a long way to go , because the justice system is not right Justice is corrupt , "" he says "" That's why she has the blindfold over her eyes and the scale slightly tilted , so you know that it can go either way . Jim Bruemmer sees things differently The white , 83 - year-old retired advertising executive in St . Louis , who participated in the CNN  KFF poll , says media coverage alleging racism - - particularly when it comes to law enforcement officers - - has been overblown "" I am troubled by the bias I see in the media , that seems to spend all its time talking about the bad policemen and the bad white people and ignoring the crime and the disastrous conditions that are occurring in large segments of the black youth , "" he says Bruemmer says he's had to look no further than a suburb of St . Louis to see that firsthand "" The belief is so universally held among the people I know , that the whole Ferguson thing was a farce , "" he says , "" that ' hands up , don't shoot ' was baloney , that the police officer behaved in a very proper manner and saved his own life , possibly . Gauging changes in racial attitudes is complicated , says Eduardo Bonilla-Silva , a professor of sociology at Duke University Bonilla-Silva has a phrase he uses to describe the situation he sees today : "" new racism . The fallacy of colorblind post-raciality "" After the 1960s and early 1970s , somehow we developed the mythology that systemic racism disappeared , "" he says Racism remained , according to Bonilla-Silva , but became more covert "" The main problem nowadays is not the folks with the hoods , but the folks dressed in suits , "" he says "" New racism , "" he says , has been decades in the making But something has changed in recent years - - access to cell phones and social media Accusations that police use excessive force , particularly against African-Americans , for example , now can get far more attention - - far more quickly - - than ever Communities of color across the country can more easily connect , according to Bonilla-Silva , and people are picking up on patterns that scholars have long discussed "" People are doing Sociology 101 They can connect Walter Scott , the assassinations of black folks in a church , the slamming of a girl in a school , "" he says "" And then it's across the nation People are then connecting the dots and saying , ' No more . ' While the trend of a growing percentage of people viewing racism as a big problem in recent years was true across racial lines in the CNN  KFF poll , the share who see it as a problem is notably higher among blacks and Hispanics About two-thirds of blacks ( 66 % ) and Hispanics ( 64 % ) said racism is a big problem , while just over four in 10 ( 43 % ) whites said the same Hispanics are much more likely now to say racism is a big problem than they were in 1995 , when less than half responded that way Among blacks , the share who said racism was a big problem dropped from 68 % in 1995 to 50 % in 2011 , and now has climbed back to 66 % Majorities across races said tensions between racial and ethnic groups in the United States have increased in the past 10 years Roughly a quarter said tensions have stayed the same Sometimes the way people view racism can play out like a referee's call in a baseball game , says Glenn Adams , a professor of psychology at the University of Kansas who has studied perceptions of racism "" Is the guy out or safe Well , it depends who you're rooting for , "" he says "" Sometimes it's clear in either direction , but we tend to see it how we want to see it . ""It's likely the level of racism in the United States is more or less the same , Adams says "" What's changed , "" he says , "" is that more people are aware of it . Knowledge of history , having friends who've experienced racism and personal background are all factors that can contribute to a greater awareness of racism , he says And now , he says , there's likely another factor at play "" People are more aware of it because of the videos of police violence and the media attention Now , the media report on it , "" Adams says "" Black folks tended to know about this before Now white folks are starting to know about it more ... Now , with this kind of evidence , people have to re-evaluate their sense of what is true and what is not true , so it becomes a little bit harder for people to deny . The same goes for repeated incidents of racism on college campuses , Bonilla-Silva says , like the chant that shuttered a fraternity at the University of Oklahoma and the noose found hanging at Duke this year ""It's impossible to dismiss cases as isolated events , he says , when similar situations at schools and other institutions keep happening again and again "" The fact that it keeps happening tells you that the problem is not a problem of bad apples , "" he says , "" but perhaps the problem is the apple tree . Because of his complexion , sometimes people think Rick Gonzales is Italian Sometimes they think he's Mexican or Middle Eastern The experience , he says , has made him question the meaning of race "" It's obviously a label Something tells me that we're all kind of in the same boat , yet we're separated somehow ""We're given different names , "" says Gonzales , a 49 - year-old truck driver from San Antonio , who participated in the CNN  KFF poll Gonzales ' mother is from Mexico and his father is from the United States He says he feels that for people in power - - most of whom are white - - it's advantageous to pit groups against each other And to him , it seems like no matter what , darker-skinned people are at a disadvantage That , he says , is why race - - and racism - - remain big problems "" The ones that are usually getting the short end of the stick are the so-called minority ... but we're the majority , because we're always the ones who are struggling , "" he says Sheryl Sims , an African-American , 59 - year-old retired teacher in Atlanta who participated in the CNN  KFF poll , says that for her , racism is something she senses when she walks down the street in her neighborhood "" It's just the way people will shun you , "" she says , "" or turn their head when you walk by . Things were worse 50 or 60 years ago , Alex Sproul says But now , the 24 - year-old , who lives in the San Francisco Bay Area and participated in the CNN  KFF poll , says he sees racism lurking under the surface From wage inequality to accessibility to jobs , Sproul says he feels minorities are still at a disadvantage Sproul describes himself as mixed race - - Mexican-American and white He says several events in recent years have made him feel racial tensions are on the rise One of them , he says , was the 2009 shooting death of Oscar Grant , an unarmed African-American man who was fatally shot by a police officer on a Bay Area Rapid Transit platform Sproul says he first learned about the case when he was scanning his Facebook feed and saw posts from friends "" You kind of see more of these situations , or extremes , "" he says "" I don't know if maybe it was going on before and there was no coverage , or if it's happening with greater frequency . Bruemmer , the retired advertising executive in St . Louis , says he sees racism as a big problem - - but not for the reason you might think Too often , he says , leaders play the race card rather than addressing what he sees as the real issue behind many of the problems popping up in society today : broken families , particularly in the black community "" The massive problem that I see is that our leaders at the highest level ... do not even want to recognize or even acknowledge that this problem exists , and therefore they spend huge amounts of time demonizing the police force , throwing gasoline and making the problems much worse , "" he says Racism is inevitable in any society , he says But now , he fears that because of bad leadership , tensions are on the rise among some groups in the United States "" I think the racism and the hatred of the white race has grown to the point where it's worse than in the other direction ... I think the anger and the racism is much worse from black to white than white to black , "" he says ""It's hard to draw a clear conclusion when the reasons behind respondents ' answers to a survey question can vary so widely , says Mark Naison , a professor of history and African-American studies at Fordham University "" People may agree that racism is worse , "" he says , "" and disagree profoundly on who the targets and victims are . "" Simmering rage , "" he says , has been fueled by backlash after Obama's election , the economic struggles of lower - and middle-income whites and demographic shifts across the country "" Latent racism is becoming more open , because a lot of people are feeling threatened , "" he says But Naison says he's also noticed a significant change in his classes "" People are able to empathize , communicate and talk honestly across racial lines much better than they did five years ago , and certainly 10 years ago and 20 years ago , "" he says Why Naison says the changing world students are living in , full of far more multiracial families and friendships , has played a big role A video of a police beating , he says , resonates for people now because they're not looking at those involved as strangers "" It's not just that guy over there , "" he says "" You could be beating my cousin or my boyfriend . The mix of "" simmering rage "" and growing empathy is a complicated equation , he says , that adds up to more people talking about race - - and racism And it's a conversation , according to Naison , that isn't going away any time soon If people from different backgrounds can open up about their concerns and find common ground , it could be a good thing , Naison says , like a therapy session on a national scale "" That conversation is difficult , "" he says "" But our history is difficult Our present is difficult We need to talk about it .

0,"A life is a life The unbearable pain of losing someone you love is identical no matter how differently it is expressed And yet the varying shades of the global reaction to tragedy based on location , nationality , ethnicity , culture and religion belie our humanity , a harsh reminder that our "" global community "" is an illusion , despite our seemingly desperate desire to cling to that notion In the wake of the terror attacks in Brussels on March 22 , which claimed 35 lives , moments of silence for the victims were held in Washington and Madrid and across Britain , among other places A sign was rolled out on a highway in France reading , "" We are all Brussels . The colors of the Belgian flag lighted monuments in Paris , Berlin , Rome , Amsterdam , New York and Dubai As a correspondent based in Turkey , which itself has been the victim of terrorism in recent months , I listened to some of the questions being raised in the wake of the tragedy in Belgium Has violence become so routine in some countries that it simply doesn't trigger a "" global "" outpouring of support Is it physical distance or some sort of psychological chasm that can lead to a muted response when an individual of a different ethnicity , culture or religion is killed The response echoed the reaction to last year's Charlie Hebdo attacks , when millions took to the streets of Paris and across France Leaders from around the world attended a march , locking arms in what was hailed as an iconic moment of solidarity Back then , Twitter and social media erupted in #JeSuisCharlie messages of support This past week , Brussels was the top trending word in dozens of languages , while messages such as "" Pray for Brussels "" and "" Pray for Belgium "" were widely shared But this outpouring of sympathy has also caused many to ask , why the resounding silence when it comes to violence elsewhere As @KateLueck tweeted , "" It's also super sad that so many people forget about turkey and what happened there several times #PrayForTheWorld "" Perhaps it is the shock of an attack in a stable and safe Western nation that generated 24 - hour rolling coverage in the Western media , with blow-by-blow updates of manhunts , intelligence failures and other details Or maybe it is the sobering realization that what happens "" over there "" is no longer foreign and strange It is very real Turkey has been hit by at least six attacks since last summer , strikes that ripped through demonstrations , tourists in Istanbul's historic district and its main vibrant pedestrian thoroughfare , and civilian and military targets in the capital of Ankara The violence was in the headlines for a day or two , and then the news cycle and the social media spheres moved on The question then too was raised : We prayed for Paris ; what about Ankara Twitter user @RihannaXShe said , "" Have you seen the world supporting Turkey ? ? Every life matters No matter where they live #PrayForOurWorld "" Yes , every life does matter But judging by the reaction on social media , it seems to matter more the closer it is to you , the more one relates to what happened or perhaps based on the circumstances around the loss of life This is something that works both ways ; look at the response to the Brussels attacks in non-Western newspapers and outlets Covered , yes , but not as extensively Indeed , the response can vary even within nations Turks did not take to the streets en masse in October , in the aftermath of the deadliest attack in the nation's modern history , when twin suicide bombers ripped through a peace rally in the capital of Ankara Perhaps the broader debate to be had , then , is how we relate to one another on a "" global "" level Violence in Iraq , Kenya , Nigeria , Syria , Yemen and beyond often barely makes the news , much less generates the level of social media outrage we saw last week Citizens of those nations are confronted with the horrors of war , the bloodcurdling screams of the aftermath of attacks , with such frequency that it has forcibly become a part of their norm There is a brief sigh of relief when they and those they love survive , the fear of stepping outside and becoming the next statistic continuously lurking in their psyche But it is seen as something they have no choice but to live with After the Brussels attacks , refugees trapped in Greece lifted signs expressing solidarity , the pain of the aftermath of senseless violence all too familiar to them One especially popular photograph is of a boy lifting a sign that reads "" Sorry for Brussels . In response , there is an especially touching response by a Belgian child : "" We're OK ""It's not your fault ! Sadly , in today's world , such empathy is all too often lost amidst the rise of the extreme right and anti-immigrant sentiment One refugee woman said shortly after the Brussels attacks , "" What happened today in Belgium is so bad for us , maybe they will be more afraid of us . The sad reality is that she has already been proved correct Last week's events crushed compassion , turned people against each other when they are considered to be the "" other , "" widened the abyss created by racism and other prejudice of various descriptions , and permeated political rhetoric in Europe and the United States The truth is , most of us do care more for our own , for those who we perceive to be "" like us . And while part of that is perhaps just human nature , it should not translate into indifference to the suffering of others Nor , of course , should it result in shunning and fearing "" the other . Sadly , though , it does And as long as that remains the norm , terror will always be the winner "
0,"She was married to the most wanted man in the world , the leader of ISIS In her first interview since her release from a Lebanese prison last year , Saja al-Dulaimi recalled to CNN Swedish affiliate Expressen TV what it was like to be Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's wife and what she fears for the daughter she bore with him Expressen said it spoke to Dulaimi , 28 , in a secret location near the border of Lebanon and Syria CNN could not verify any of her claims , from those detailing her relationship with Baghdadi to her insistence she doesn't support terrorism in any way ( In fact , she was part of a prisoner swap with al Nusra Front , an al Qaeda affiliate , according to a Lebanese security official . Regardless , here is what Dulaimi herself had to say : ' He was a family man ' Born in Iraq to an upper-middle-class conservative family , Dulaimi was married off to Baghdadi in 2008 He was not a bloodthirsty terrorist back then , she claims "" I married a normal person , a university lecturer , "" she said "" He was a family man . She wasn't his only bride ; she had to share him with another wife "" He went to work and came home to his family , "" Dulaimi said "" He was great He was the children's ideal father The way he was with children ... he was a teacher - - you know how teachers are He knew how to deal with children , better than how to deal with the mother . But the two did not talk much like others couples do The reason He had a "" mysterious personality , "" Dulaimi answered Mia Bloom - - a Georgia State University professor and author of the 2011 book , "" Bombshell : Women and Terror "" - - finds it "" conceivable that ( Baghdadi ) was living a double life "" his new wife knew little or nothing about "" The ( idea ) that he didn't tell her anything ... was because she was not privy to the ( other ) side of him , the mujahid side of him , "" Bloom told CNN Dulaimi did know , though , that Baghdadi had a second wife who didn't like the idea of her entering the picture "" It's hard for two wives to live together , "" Dulaimi said Their union , she said , ended seven years ago after just three months Dulaimi said she ran away from Baghdadi after she became pregnant She wouldn't say exactly why , but explained , "" I wasn't happy . She told Expressen TV that she did not love him "" The fact that I got out is proof of that , "" she said He tried to get her back several times "" But I'd already made my mind up , "" she said They last spoke in 2009 , Dulaimi said , when Baghdadi again tried to get her back She didn't tell him that she bore him a daughter But he found out a while later , she said "" He said he'd take her when I remarry , "" Dulaimi said Dulaimi is worried for her daughter's safety "" I'm scared of everyone ; that's what's happened , "" she said She is very concerned for the girl , who reportedly wants to get an education abroad "" She's the one who now ... suffers , "" her mother said "" She has the entire world's disaster upon her shoulders . Now the young mother dreams of a life with her daughter in Europe She wants the girl to go to school It will be a better and safer life , she believes "" I want to live in a European country , not an Arab country , "" she said "" I want my children to live and get an education . "" Even if her mother was married to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi , a terrorist ... what is the child guilty of there ? Bloom , the terrorism expert , said that Dulaimi has reason to worry about her children's safety - - both from Baghdadi's agents who might kidnap them or those who oppose ISIS who might take it out on his kin "" I think , "" Bloom said , "" that these children are very much in danger . Dulaimi was arrested in late 2014 in Lebanon after she'd crossed over from Syria in what a knowledgeable source called a "" planned operation . One year later , authorities released her and a group of Islamists in exchange for Lebanese troops captured by al Nusra Front , a Lebanese security official said on condition of anonymity Al Nusra - - which the Institute for the Study of War and American Enterprise Institute claimed earlier this year is "" much more dangerous to the U . S . than "" ISIS , its rival in Syria - - has several connections to Dulaimi A brother is a senior al Nusra figure and her new husband is suspected of being involved in the group , a separate Lebanese security source told CNN Yet Dulaimi said she's sad to think she will always be thought of as Baghdadi's ex-wife , thus someone who supports terror "" I'm branded a terrorist , but I'm far from all that , "" she said Europeans should accept her , regardless of her past relationship with Baghdadi , she said "" No bearer of burdens shall bear another's burden "" I mean , where is my guilt if I was married to him in 2008 ""We're divorced now I was the one who left him , not the other way around . "" I'm a woman who's been through a lot and had to suffer in prison , "" said Dulaimi , who was arrested in Lebanon in December 2014 as she was trying to enter the country from Syria "" Now I want to settle down . "" If I'd wanted to live with him , I'd have lived like a princess , "" she said "" I could have moved in with them and had loads of money But I don't want money . She wants something more "" I want to live in freedom , [ to ] live like everyone else . "
0,"Racism is the belief that characteristics and abilities can be attributed to people simply on the basis of their race and that some racial groups are superior to others Racism and discrimination have been used as powerful weapons encouraging fear or hatred of others in times of conflict and war , and even during economic downturns Racism is also a very touchy subject for some people , as issues concerning free speech and Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights come into play Some people argue that talking about supporting racial discrimination and prejudice is just words and that free speech should allow such views to be aired without restriction Others point out that these words can lead to some very dire and serious consequences ( the Nazi government policies being one example ) In a short introductory video the Understanding Race project from the American Anthropological Association says race is a powerful idea and an enduring concept , invented by society It has also fostered inequality and discrimination for centuries , as well as influencing how we relate to other human beings "" Europe has a regional human rights architecture which is unrivaled elsewhere in the world "" , Amnesty International notes in their 2010 report on the Europe and Central Asia region But the human rights watchdog also adds that as well as guarding a proud reputation as a beacon of human rights , "" it is sadly still the case , however , that the reality of protection from human rights abuses for many of those within its borders falls short of the rhetoric . In recent years , one of those forms of abuses has been in the area of race , often growing with changing economic circumstances and increased immigration to the region From the institutionalized racism especially in colonial times , when racial beliefs — even eugenics — were not considered something wrong , to recent times where the effects of neo-Nazism is still felt , Europe is a complex area with many cultures in a relatively small area of land that has seen many conflicts throughout history ( Many of these conflicts have had trade , resources and commercial rivalry at their core , but national identities have often added fuel to some of these conflicts . Racism has also been used to justify exploitation , even using "" pseudo-science "" : Debates over the origins of racism often suffer from a lack of clarity over the term Many conflate recent forms of racism with earlier forms of ethnic and national conflict In most cases ethno-national conflict seems to owe to conflict over land and strategic resources In some cases ethnicity and nationalism were harnessed to wars between great religious empires ( for example , the Muslim Turks and the Catholic Austro-Hungarians ) As Benedict Anderson has suggested in Imagined Communities , ethnic identity and ethno-nationalism became a source of conflict within such empires with the rise of print-capitalism In its modern form , racism evolved in tandem with European exploration and conquest of much of the rest of the world , and especially after Christopher Columbus reached the Americas As new peoples were encountered , fought , and ultimately subdued , theories about "" race "" began to develop , and these helped many to justify the differences in position and treatment of people whom they categorized as belonging to different races ( see Eric Wolf's Europe and the People Without History ) Another possible source of racism is the misunderstanding of Charles Darwin's theories of evolution Some took Darwin's theories to imply that since some "" races "" were more civilized , there must be a biological basis for the difference At the same time they appealed to biological theories of moral and intellectual traits to justify racial oppression There is a great deal of controversy about race and intelligence , in part because the concepts of both race and IQ are themselves controversial ( Racism , Wikipedia , The Free Encyclopedia , May 1 , 2004 ) In "" the century of total war "" , and the new millenium , Europe is seeing an alarming resurgence in xenophobia and racial hatred A short review from the Inter Press Service highlights the rise of neo-Nazism in 2000 in Europe and suggests that "" far from being a fringe activity , racism , violence and neo-nationalism have become normal in some communities The problems need to tackled much earlier , in schools and with social programmes . Ethnic minorities and different cultures in one country can often be used as a scapegoat for the majority during times of economic crisis That is one reason why Nazism became so popular In France , May 2002 , the success of far right politician Le Pen in the run for leadership ( though he lost out in the end ) sent a huge shockwave throughout Europe , about how easy it was for far right parties to come close to getting power if there is complacency in the democratic processes and if participation is reduced In various places throughout Western Europe , in 2002 , as Amnesty International highlights , there has been a rise in racist attacks and sentiments against both Arabs and Jews , in light of the increasing hostilities in the Middle East Earlier in 1998 , in an area of Germany a right wing racist party won an unprecedented number of votes In Austria , the Freedom Party was able to secure the majority of the cabinet posts The party is an extreme far right party , whose leader , Jorg Heider , has been accused of sympathetic statements towards the Nazis The European Union has reacted to this indicating that Austria's participation may be in jeopardy This Guardian Special Report has much more in-depth coverage In Italy , there are attempts to try and deal with the rise in undocumented immigrants from Tunisia The reactions from the right wing have been labeled by some as being "" openly racist "" Into 2010 and problems of racism in Italy continue For example , a wave of violence against African farm workers in southern Italy left some 70 people injured This resulted in police having to evacuate over 300 workers from the region The workers were easy targets being exploited as fruit pickers living in difficult conditions They earn "" starvation wages "" according to a BBC reporter , doing "" backbreaking work which Italians do not want "" in a labor market controlled by the local mafia Spain has seen increased racial violence The growing economy invites immigrants from North African countries such as Morocco However , the poor conditions that immigrants have had to endure and the already racially charged region has led to friction and confrontations In 1997 , Human Rights Watch noted that , "" The U . K . has one of the highest levels of racially-motivated violence and harassment in Western Europe , and the problem is getting worse . In April 1999 , London saw two bombs explode in predominantly ethnic minority areas , in the space of one week , where a Nazi group has claimed responsibility The summer of 2001 saw many race-related riots in various parts of northern England For over a decade , immigration issues have been headlines in the UK The nature of the discussions bear a clear racial dimension as well as hostility to Eastern Europeans , such as those from Poland Anti-immigrant rhetoric has also contributed to increasing interest in racist political parties such as the British National Party This also , predictably , has increased as the global financial crisis impacts more of Britain's population Anti immigration sentiment has also been seen in Switzerland as the country has repeatedly tightened its asylum policy due to concerns about increasing numbers of illegal migrants Greece has one of the worst records in the European Union for racism against ethnic minorities , according to the BBC Anti-immigrant sentiment has long been high , especially against ethnic Albanians , who form the largest minority Until the 1990s , the BBC notes , Greece had been an extremely homogenous society With the fall of communism many immigrants from Eastern Europe came to Greece Albanians especially have been targetted by a lot of racist sentiment Some hostage taking by a few Albanians in recent years has not helped the situation Russia has seen violent anti-racism on the rise in recent years together with the rise of neo-Nazism ( which is a cruel irony given the immense death toll the Soviet Union suffered at the hands of Nazi Germany during World War II ) Although the previous report is from 2006 , Amnesty International's 2010 report shows that despite greater recognition of the problem , effective programs to tackle the issue still do not exist So far , the above represents an incredibly tiny number of examples and details Many , many more events haven't been mentioned , as it is admittedly difficult to keep up with all the different items For more details and up-to-date information , one web site to check out the UK-based Institute of Race Relations and their subsection attempting to document the rising support for the extreme-Right in local and central government in Europe , building on a platform of populist anti-immigrant policies In 1987 , a sensational "" discovery "" was made by a Sydney University team , led by Australia's most celebrated pre-historian , Professor D J Mulvaney They reported that the Australian population in 1788 was 750,000 , or three times the previous estimate They concluded that more than 600,000 people had died as result of white settlement ( John Pilger , Cathy Freeman's broad Olympic smile is being used to conceal a multitude of Australia's original sins , July 10 , 2000 ) In June 1998 , One Nation , an Australian nationalist party in Queensland won 25 percent of the votes with their main lines at fighting immigration by non-whites This was made possible where unemployment was been high and where it was easy to convince the people that immigrants were taking their jobs , as it would serve to be a convenient excuse and avenue to vent frustration In a speech the party leader said that Australia was "" in danger of being swamped "" by Asians and she also questioned the special welfare benefits for Australia's Aborigines The reaction to that meant the same party won only 6 percent of the votes two months later , in the State elections Australia has also had a very racist past in which apartheid has been practiced and where indigenous Aboriginal people have lost almost all their land and suffered many prejudices In the past , the notorious policy that led to the Stolen Generation was practiced This was the institutionalized attempt to prevent Aboriginal children ( and thus future generations ) from being socialized into Aboriginal culture ( This also occurred in various parts of the Americas too . Aborigines are the poorest group in Australia and suffer from very much preventable diseases For more about these issues , you can start at these harrowing reports from John Pilger a prominent Australian journalist who has been critical of many western policies The Sydney 2000 Olympics also brought some of Australia's racist past and present to the fore ( On the positive side , many parts of Australia's rich diversity in people is slowly helping relieve prejudism However , some more traditional and conservative politicians are still openly racist . In 2008 , a study found that Australians in general are welcoming of diversity but some 1 in 10 Australians still hold racist views — a ratio likely to be less than in some European countries , but still high the lead researcher noted Muslims were most feared or loathed for "" not belonging "" , and followed by indigenous Australians and Africans In 2009 and 2010 , there were increasing racist attacks against Indians with many Indians in Melbourne fearing racist attacks and lynchings were increasing It even led to the Indian government issuing an advisory warning about the dangers of traveling to Melbourne A number of nations in Africa are at war or civil war , or have been very recently , just few years after they have gained their independence from former colonial countries While most of the conflicts have resources at their core and involve a number of non-African nations and corporations , additional fuel is added to the conflict by stirring up ethnic differences and enticing hatred ( Also not that the artificial boundaries imposed in Africa by European colonialism and imperialism during the divide and rule policies has further exacerbated this situation and plays an enormous role in the root causes of these conflicts compared to what mainstream media presents . In Zimbabwe , there has been increasing racism against the white farmers , due to poverty and lack of land ownership by Africans South Africa until recently suffered from Apartheid , which legally segregated the African population from the Europeans For more about conflicts in Africa , check out this site's section on Africa In a number of countries in the Middle East , discriminatory practice has been commonplace , mostly against foreign workers who work in low wage conditions , such as domestic workers Reports of taking away foreign worker's passports and treating them as second class citizens are unfortunately commonplace Inter Press Service ( IPS ) describes how Lebanon has these discrimination problems even though it is often considered relatively open compared to its neighbors , due to freedoms enjoyed by women For example , people of color face discrimination at work and away from work , often not allowed at some beaches or clubs , or allowed with various restrictions In addition , property rights are severely curtailed , even for Palestinians who are the same race , but not nationals Worsening discrimination in recent months seen at various beaches in Lebanon was "" symptomatic of the widespread racism that exists in Lebanon "" says Ali Fakhri , communication director at Indyact , a Lebanese NGO finding that all of the 20 beaches investigated barred domestic workers from Asia and Africa from using their facilities Fakhri also feels that the culture of discrimination is socially accepted in Lebanon , and is seen in the government and private sector as well as among individuals , according to IPS and the discrimination  racism does not only target people of color , but is also class oriented and sectarian Highlighting the effects a legal system can have on culture , a lawyer also interviewed by IPS notes that "" The Lebanese constitution states that all Lebanese are equal in the eyes of the law , but no mention is made of the rights of foreigners . In the absence of a unified civil law , such discrimination will continue she adds : "" The Lebanese legal system follows different rules of law that vary from one community to the other It is a situation that naturally leads to inequality among people . As well as these cultural practices , there has also been a geopolitical dimension : For a long time there has been resentment by many in the Middle East at the policies of America in their region For many of the more extremist factions , this has turned into a form of racism as well , where many things that are Western are hated or despised The situation of Palestine and Israel is also very contentious While Arabs and Jews technically do not belong to different races , their religious and cultural differences and the political history of the region has contributed to extremities and tensions — by perhaps a minority , but perhaps an influential and often vocal and violent minority — resulting in prejudice on both sides With the terrible acts of terrorism committed by terrorists in America , on September 11 , 2001 , there has additionally been an outpouring of violent racial hatred by a minority of people in Western countries against people that look Middle Eastern ( some who are not Middle Eastern , such as Indians , have even been beaten or killed ) Furthermore , with the American-led attacks in Afghanistan in retaliation for those terrorist attacks , from Egypt to Pakistan , there have been minorities of people who have protested violently in the streets , and also committed racist acts , attacking anything that appears Western , from Western citizens , to even UNICEF and other UN buildings Yet , this is more complex than just a clash of religions and race , as deeper an issue is the geopolitical and economic activities of the past decades and centuries that have fueled these social tensions See this web site's section on the Middle East for more on that In Cambodia , there has been a strong anti-Vietnamese sentiment In Indonesia there has been a lot of violence against the affluent Chinese population who have been blamed for economic problems that have plagued the country in recent years As noted by Wikipedia in an article on racism , "" until 2003 , Malaysia enforced discriminatory laws limiting access to university education for Chinese students who are citizens by birth of Malaysia , and many other laws explicitly favoring bumiputras ( Malays ) remain in force . In India , there has long been discrimination against what is considered the lowest class in Hinduism , the Dalits , or untouchables , as well as sectarian and religious violence Although it has been outlawed by the Indian Constitution , the caste system was a way to structure inequality into the system itself And while outlawed , the social barriers it creates is still prevalent in rural areas where most Indians live It also features in the view of Hindu extremists and traditionalists At various times , there have also been tensions between different religious groups , such as Hindus and Muslims with both sides having their fair share of extremists While this is not racism , technically — as people of all classes are of the same race — the prejudice that had come with the caste system is quite similar to what is seen with racism A report from Survival International about the plight of the Innu people in Canada also reveals how racism can be a factor In the words of the authors , the "" report reveals how racist government policies , under the guise of benevolent ' progress ' , have crippled the Innu of eastern Canada — a once self-sufficient and independent people . ( While this report is about the problems of an indigenous people in Canada , it is a common story throughout history for many peoples and cultures . In the US , racism is a well known issue From racial profiling to other issues such as affirmative action , police brutality against minorities and the history of slavery and the rising resentment against immigrants The American Anthropological Association produced a short video providing an overview of how prevailing ideas in science , government and culture intersected throughout history to shape American concept of race today : Since the horrific terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11 , 2001 , Security concerns have understandably increased , but so too has racial profiling , discrimination etc In the early aftermath of the attacks some Americans that were understandably outraged and horrified , even attacked some members of the Sikh community where at least one was even killed , because they resembled certain types of Muslims , with beards and turbans Various people of Middle East or South Asian origin have faced controversial detentions or questionings by officials at American airports This web site's section on the war against terror has more details on these aspects It was a historic moment for America when they voted in their first black president , Barack Obama , given America's history Yet , it seems that some of his policies have met with near hysterical opposition ( his attempt to push a somewhat more inclusive health system has been decried as socialist , or even communist , for example ) One can't help but see the increasing criticism from right wing segments having a racist , almost coordinated , undertone to it He is Christian , although his middle name is Hussein , which right wingers have used to claim he is Muslim , anti-Christ and so on , which further fuels racial and discriminatory sentiments Leonard Zeskind , head of the Institute for Research and Education on Human Rights , pointed out that the anti-Obama "" opposition "" contains many different political elements : [ Elements of anti-Obama opposition ] include ultra-conservative Republicans of both the Pat Buchanan and free market variety ; anti-tax Tea Party libertarians from the Ron Paul camp ; Christian right activists intent on re-molding the country into their kind of Kingdom ; birth certificate conspiracy theorists , anti-immigrant nativists of the armed Minuteman and the policy wonk variety ; third party "" constitutionalists "" ; and white nationalists of both the citizens councils and the Stormfront national socialist variety ( Bill Berkowitz , US : White Supremacists Crash Anti-Obama Tea Party , Inter Press Service , December 22 , 2009 ) It seems that many people who join supremacist groups do so at a young age , and a lot of recruiting by these various hate groups are targeted at children A reformed skinhead adds how easy it can be for some people , to be recruited into these groups , especially children On the anniversary of Adolph Hitler's birthday in April 1999 , a planned killing spree at the now infamous Columbine High School in America by two children claimed the lives of many fellow school mates It is reported that they were targeting ethnic minorities and were involved in some Nazi related activities In USA , the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 ( incidentally , the day before the birthday of Adolph Hitler ) triggered anti-Muslim sentiments , even though it was not an Islamic group at all The previous link reports that there was a 60 % increase in discrimination of Muslims in the USA And during the week of Adolf Hitler's birthday , in 1999 , neo-Nazi groups were suspected of planting two nail bombs that exploded in predominantly ethnic minority areas of London The following week , a gay bar in London's Soho area was also bombed killing at least 3 people The fact that the Stephen Lawrence case , which , in UK is one of the perhaps most infamous on-going cases of racism in the police force and has received much attention at the time of this bombing could be more than coincidence One group of people that often go unnoticed when it comes to racism and discrimination are Gypsies In Europe they have been persecuted to a similar extent as the Jews throughout history , including World War II and even now they are largely mistreated or ignored And while the World Wide Web is a great proponent for the ideals of free speech , it can also be a breeding ground harboring hatred This is very serious as the number of hate sites that have sprung up in the recent years is shocking and also increasing at an alarming rate There has been much talk of Internet sites hosting hate material Some groups such as HateWatch have gone as far as buying racist domain names so that real racists cannot buy these domains themselves For more about the Internet and free speech , check out this site's section on human rights and the Internet It has some useful links to additional sites and material As globalization in its current form expands , so too does the inequality that accompanies it , as discussed throughout the Trade , Economy , & Related Issues section on this web site Rising inequality can result in an increase in racial bias for scapegoating or advancing xenophobic and isolationist tendencies During French and British Imperial days for example , racial bias was ingrained within the culture itself ( as explored in great detail by Edward Said , in his books such as Orientalism ( Vintage Books , 1979 ) and Culture & Imperialism ( Vintage Books , 1993 ) ) However , an element of this is also seen in today's period of globalization , with what A . Sivanandan describes as the increasing "" xenophobic culture of globalisation "" seen in some parts of the world : Racism has always been both an instrument of discrimination and a tool of exploitation But it manifests itself as a cultural phenomenon , susceptible to cultural solutions , such as multicultural education and the promotion of ethnic identities Tackling the problem of cultural inequality , however , does not by itself redress the problem of economic inequality Racism is conditioned by economic imperatives , but negotiated through culture : religion , literature , art , science and the media ... Once , they demonised the blacks to justify slavery Then they demonised the "" coloureds "" to justify colonialism Today , they demonise asylum seekers to justify the ways of globalism And , in the age of the media , of spin , demonisation sets out the parameters of popular culture within which such exclusion finds its own rationale — usually under the guise of xenophobia , the fear of strangers ( A . Sivanandan , Poverty is the new black , The Guardian , August 17 , 2001 ) With expanding globalization , the demands for more skilled workers , especially in North America , Europe and elsewhere ( while they cut back on education spending themselves , little by little ) , has led to increased efforts to attract foreign workers — but filtered , based on skill At the same time , this increases resentment by those in those nations who are not benefitting from globalization Additionally , those trying to escape authoritarian regimes etc are finding it harder and harder to get into these countries , due to tighter immigration policies Hence it is harder to immigrate to the wealthier nations unless , says Liz Fekete , "" these citizens are part of the chosen few : highly-skilled computer wizards , doctors and nurses trained at Third World expense and sought after by the West Global migration management strategy saps the Third World and the former Soviet bloc of its economic lifeblood , by creaming off their most skilled and educated workforces . From the perspective of globalization , Liz continues , "" the skills pool , not the genes pool , is key . Immigrants face numerous criticisms and challenges ; It is difficult enough often , to get into another nation as mentioned above If one succeeds , then additional struggles ( some to naturally be expected , of course ) are faced : Living in a new country can be daunting , especially when the cultural differences are great As a result it can be expected that an immigrant would try to maintain some semblance of their own culture in their new country of stay Or , due to fears of racism or due to the culture shock it would be expected that immigrant communities would form as a way to deal with this and as a means to help each other through By doing this , sometimes they face criticism of not integrating and of "" sticking with their own kind "" ; Yet , on the other hand , if they do integrate in some way , they face critique from certain types of environmentalists and others of contributing to environmental degradation by increasing their consumption to the high levels typical of the host nation ( And if environmental degradation is the concern , then it would make sense that one of the main issues at hand to address would be the consumption itself and its roots , regardless of who is doing it — in this context That is , if the host nation had different modes of consumptions , immigrants would likely follow those too Hence , singling out immigrants for being a factor in environmental degradation is often unfair , and itself hints of prejudice and of attitudes — intentional or not — almost like "" stay out ; we want to maintain and not share our lifestyle and standards of living ; we recognize it is wasteful but if not too many are doing it , then it is ok "" etc . For more about these issues of resource consumption , blaming the poor and immigrants etc , see this web site's section debating population and consumption issues A UN Global Conference to discuss racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance was held from 31st August to 7 September 2001 While it was brave enough for the United Nations to attempt to hold such a meeting , it proved to be a heated challenge While all nations are good at being critical of others ( and often very accurately , although often not ) , when it comes to one's own criticisms , most would be uncomfortable to say the least As an example : United States and Europe were against effective discussions of slavery reparations ( and sent in only low-level delegates — a possible sign on how they really feel about this conference , and what it is about ) Israel and United States were against discussing the possibility that Zionism is racist against Palestinians , causing both to walk out of the conference altogether India was against including discussions about caste-based discrimination Some Arab nations were against discussions on oppression of Kurds or Arab slave trade , etc A watered down declaration was eventually made Such an eventful week shows how far we all have to go It is also a detailed issue , and the following links may provide more details : World Conference Against Racism is the official United Nations web site , OneWorld.net Special Report on Racism provides a huge number of articles from all sorts of NGO and other partners "
0,"The same spotlight of historical enquiry that scholars have long been shedding on the biblical past is now starting to illumine the origins of Islam , as Tom Holland explains Midway through the eighth century a monk living in the monastery of Beth Hale in Iraq recorded the arrival there of an eminent visitor A ' Son of Ishmael ' – one of the Arab dignitaries who served at the court of the caliph – had fallen ill Naturally enough , since Christian holy men were renowned for effecting miracle cures , he had turned to the monks to help him with his convalescence The Arab stayed ten days in the monastery and in that time he and his hosts argued freely about their respective religions The monk , of course , portrayed himself as emphatically the winner Nevertheless it is clear that the Arab had managed to land the odd blow ""' Is not our faith better than any faith that is on the earth ? ' he had demanded to know ""' And is this not the sign that God loves us and is pleased with our faith – namely , that he has given us dominion over all religions and all peoples ? ' The terms of this argument , it is true , were hardly original to Islam Back in the early fourth century Eusebius , a Palestinian bishop , had written a biography of Constantine ( r . 306-37 ) , the emperor who had stunned the Roman world by converting to Christianity God had blessed him for bowing his head before Christ with any number of rewards Eusebius , who combined the talents of a polemicist with a profound streak of hero-worship , had sheltered no doubts on that score : ' So dear was Constantine to God , and so blessed , so pious and so fortunate in all he undertook that with the greatest facility he obtained authority over more nations than any who had preceded him – and yet retained his power , undisturbed , to the very close of his life . ' This core equation – that worldly greatness was bestowed by God upon those who pleased Him – was one that reached back to the origins of human belief in the supernatural Rarely had a society existed that did not see itself as somehow blessed by divine approval Empires had invariably cast themselves as the favourites of the gods So it was , some 300 years before Constantine , that Virgil had defined the Romans as a people entrusted by the heavens with a sacred charge : to spare the vanquished and to overthrow the haughty A potent sentiment and an enduring one Muslims as well as Christians had proven to be its heirs The Qu'ran , composed though it was on the margins of the Roman world during the seventh century , bore witness to a conception of imperial mission that was not so different from the pretensions of Virgil's day : ' When you encounter the unbelievers , blows to necks it shall be until , once you have routed them , you are to tighten their fetters . ' So Muhammad , serving as the mouthpiece of God , had informed his followers ""' Thereafter , it is either gracious bestowal of freedom or holding them to ransom , until war has laid down its burdens . ' Yet by the time of Muhammad ( 570-632 ) much had changed from the heyday of the pagan empire and to seismic effect The revolutionary notion that the universe was governed by a single , all-powerful god had decisively transformed people's understanding of what the sanction of the heavens might mean Just as Constantine had discovered in Christ an infinitely more potent patron than Apollo or Sol Invictus had ever been , so those who turned to the pages of the Qu'ran found revealed there a celestial monarch of such limitless and terrifying power that there could certainly be no question of portraying Him – as the Christians did with their god – in human form Nothing , literally nothing , was beyond Him ""' If He wishes , O mankind , He can make you disappear and bring others in your stead . ' To a deity capable of such a prodigious feat of annihilation what was the overthrow of an empire or two Remarkable though it was that the previously despised and marginal Arabs had managed to trample down both Roman and Persian power , no explanation was needed for this , so Muslims came to believe , that did not derive from an even more awesome and heart-stopping miracle : the revelation to the Prophet of the Qu'ran What surprise that a fire lit far beyond the reach of the ancient superpowers should have spread to illuminate the entire world when that fire was the Word of God So it was , across a vast sweep of Eurasia , stretching from the Atlantic coast to the frontiers of China , that a distinctive understanding of history came to be taken for granted Whether in Christendom or in the House of Islam , the past was understood as the tracing of patterns upon the centuries by the forefinger of God The divine had intruded into the sweep of earthly events and everything had changed as a result The very fabric of time had been rent Quite how a deity who transcended eternity and space might actually have descended from heaven to earth was , of course , a tricky problem for Christians and Muslims alike to solve and it took bitter and occasionally murderous argument to arrive at anything like a consensus Only centuries after the birth of Christ did Christians come definitively to accept that their saviour had been both perfect man and perfect God ; only centuries after the emigration of Muhammad from Mecca did Muslims come definitively to accept that the Qu'ran was eternal , not created Such wrangling had been inevitable Fathoming the purposes of an omnipotent and omniscient deity was no simple matter As a ninth-century Muslim scholar , in a tone of awed defeatism , confessed : ' Imagination does not reach Him , and thinking does not comprehend Him . ' Nevertheless , while Muslims and Christians had faced similar knots their respective attempts to unravel these had set them on radically different courses The word , so it was claimed in St John's gospel , had become flesh The record of Christ's life , for all that it lay at the heart of the Christian faith , was not itself considered divine , unlike Christ himself Although Christians believed the Bible to be the word of God , they also knew that it had been mediated through fallible mortals Not only were there four different accounts of Christ's life in the Bible , but it contained a whole host of other books , written over a vast expanse of time , demanding to be sifted , compared and weighed against one other As a result the contextualising of ancient texts came to be second nature to biblical scholars , and not just to believers By the 18th century the Church had ceased to hold the monopoly on subjecting its holy texts to scholarly enquiry The model of history promoted by Eusebius , which traced in the past the working of the purposes of God , had started to become a thing of mockery In his massive account of the decline and fall of the Roman Empire , Edward Gibbon subjected some of the most venerated compositions of late antiquity to a pathologist's scalpel : ' The only defect of these pleasing compositions is the want of truth and common sense . ' So he dismissed , with his customary solemn sneer , the biographical writings of St Jerome Yet Gibbon's tone of irony was to prove a mere presentiment of the far more naked scepticism that , from the 19th century onwards , would increasingly see almost every tenet of the Christian faith subjected to merciless dissection The shock , to a still devout European public , was profound When in 1863 a lapsed seminarian by the name of Ernest Renan presumed to publish a biography of Jesus that treated its subject not as a god but as a man like any other it was condemned in horrified terms by one critic as nothing less than a ' new crucifixion of Our Lord ' The book , Life of Jesus , promptly became a runaway bestseller Scandalous it may have been , but the European public was not averse to being scandalised Time would demonstrate that there was to be no going back , in the Christian West , on the habit of subjecting to scientific enquiry what had for millennia been regarded as the sacrosanct word of God Throughout the 19th century , in the hushed and sombre libraries of German theology departments , scholars would crawl over the pages of the Bible , gnawing away at the sacred text like termites The Pentateuch , they demonstrated , far from having been written by Moses , as had traditionally been taught , seemed instead to have been stitched together from multiple sources Not only that , but these same sources had almost certainly been written centuries after the events that they purported to describe Moses , it appeared , had been made into a mouthpiece for laws that he might very well never have pronounced – if he had even existed in the first place Here was an unravelling of the scriptural tapestry so devastating that even some scholars themselves began to fret over the implications : ' It is to suspend the beginnings of Hebrew history , ' as one German theologian noted grimly , ' not upon the grand creations of Moses , but upon airy nothings . ' Yet the achievements of biblical scholarship , nihilistic though they seemed to many , remained recognisably bred of the marrow of Christian culture Debate about the authorship of the Pentateuch , after all , reached back at least to the time of Origen , the third century Alexandrian scholar The methodology that historians in the West nowadays bring to bear on ancient sources owes far more to the traditions of Christian textual analysis than it does to Herodotus or Thucydides Historicism , like so many intellectual off-shoots of the Enlightenment , is perhaps best considered as a bastard child of Christianity that then set about devouring its parent Not that it has confined itself to questioning the verities of its own ancestral faith Other religions , too , and the stories told to explain their origins have likewise been put under its microscope Sensitivities here , however , are much more raw If the scepticism of the West can often seem bleak even to those raised in its own traditions , then it can seem downright ravening to others Offensive though modes of scholarship honed on the Bible may be to Jews or Christians , they can be vastly more so to people from a different religious background And especially so to Muslims The explanation for this lies in the awe , exceptional even by the standards of other faiths , with which Muslims have always regarded their founding scripture The nearest analogy in Islam to the role played by Jesus in Christianity is not Muhammad but the Qu'ran Not merely the word of God , it is itself divine That being so , its text must inevitably defy all attempts at rational analysis Even to contemplate such a project is blasphemy Devout Muslims are no more likely to question the origins of the Qu'ran than devout Christians are to start ransacking Jerusalem for the skeleton of a man with holes in his hands and feet To treat it like any other text from antiquity , something to be prodded and taken to pieces and explained by the historical context in which it appeared , is to dabble one's fingers in the very stuff of other people's souls Revelation , so it was said , had come upon Muhammad ' like the ringing of a bell ' and had brought sweat to drip from his forehead All who then heard him repeat what he had heard knew themselves to be in the authentic presence of the divine The proof of that lay in the fact that those who had listened to him went on to dismember the two greatest empires in the world ""' We went to meet them with small abilities and weak forces , and God made us triumph , and gave us possession of their territories . ' Such was what it had meant for the eternal to meet with the diurnal The Qu'ran was a lightning strike from heaven , owing nothing to what had gone before It is here , in any interpretation of Islam as a divinely-sponsored bolt from the blue , that history must needs meet and merge with faith Almost 14 centuries on from the lifetime of Muhammad , the conviction that he was truly a prophet of God continues to move and inspire millions upon millions of people around the globe As a solution to the mystery of what might actually have taken place in the early seventh century Near East , however , it is unlikely to strike those historians raised in the traditions of secular scholarship as entirely satisfactory By explaining everything , it runs the risk of explaining nothing much at all Nevertheless it is a measure of how potently an aura of the supernatural has always clung to the Qu'ran and to the story of its genesis that historians have found it so difficult to rationalise its origins Mecca , so the biographies of the Prophet teach us , was a pagan city , devoid of any Jewish or Christian presence , situated in the midst of a vast , untenanted desert : how else , then , are we to account for the sudden appearance there of a fully fledged monotheism , complete with references to Abraham , Moses and Jesus , if not as an authentic miracle In a sense , the entire history of secular enquiry into the origins of Islam has been an attempt to arrive at a plausible answer to this question Muslims , understandably sensitive to any hint that their prophet might have been a plagiarist , have always tended to resent the inevitable implications of such a project And yet , if God is discounted as an informant , it is surely not unreasonable to wonder just how it came to be that so many characters from the Bible feature in the Qu'ran Perhaps , it has been suggested , Muhammad absorbed Jewish and Christian influences during his business trips to Syria Or perhaps , despite what the Muslim sources tell us , there were thriving colonies of Jews , or Christians , or both , in Mecca Or perhaps the Meccan economy was afflicted by a crisis of capitalism , one that saw successful merchants and financiers growing ever richer , even as those on the breadline were left , in the historian Karen's Armstrong's words , ' searching for a new spiritual and political solution to the malaise and disquiet in the city ' and finding it , somehow , in some unspecified manner , in the spirit of the age Yet all these explanations run up against an awkward stumbling block Back in the 19th century , Ernest Renan – a brilliant Arabist when not putting the cat among Christian pigeons – had contrasted the presumed excellence of the sources for the life of Muhammad with the murk surrounding the founders of other faiths ""' Islam , ' he declared , ' was born , not amid the mystery which cradles the origins of other religions , but rather in the full light of history . ' Over the past 40 years , however , this proposition has come under brutal and escalating attack – so much so , indeed , that Islam's birth , to an increasing number of scholars , now appears shrouded in an almost impenetrable darkness Although the fact that Muhammad existed is generally accepted by specialists , one Christian source , written just two years after the traditional date of his death , describes a ' false prophet ' leading the Arabs in an invasion of Palestine , while another , six years later , refers to him by name Yet the allusions in scattered Christian sources of the seventh century to an enigmatic figure whom they describe variously as ' the general ' , ' the instructor ' , or ' the king ' of the Arabs merely serves to highlight an astounding lacuna : the complete lack of reference to Muhammad in any early Muslim records Only in the 690s did a caliph finally get around to inscribing his name on a public monument ; only decades after that did the first tentative references to him start to appear in private inscriptions ; and only around 800 did biographies finally come to be written of him that Muslims took care to preserve What might have happened to earlier versions of his life we cannot know for certain One possibility is hinted at by Ibn Hisham , whose biography of Muhammad is the earliest one to have survived in the form in which we now have it Much that previous generations had recorded of the Prophet , so this biographer commented sternly , was either bogus , or irrelevant , or sacrilegious ""' Things which it is disgraceful to discuss ; matters which would distress certain people ; and such reports as I have been told are not to be accepted as trustworthy – all these things have I omitted . ' Here , then , is terra firma What we can know with absolute confidence is that by the early ninth century the precise details of what Muhammad might have said and done some 200 years previously had come to provide , for vast numbers of people , a roadmap that they believed led straight to heaven God had seized personal control of human events The world had been set upon a novel course To doubt this conviction was to risk hellfire Given this perspective it is scarcely surprising that any ambition to write history or biography as we might understand it should have paled into nothingness compared with the infinitely more pressing obligation to trace in the pattern of the Prophet's life the wishes and purposes of the almighty That is why , in leaving the ninth century behind and venturing back into the heaving ocean of uncertainty and conjecture that is the early history of Islam , today's historians can find it such a struggle to identify reliable charts Adrift amid the shadowy vastness , what prospect of finding landfall Of course , there is always the Qu'ran and yet the holy text itself , once stripped of all its cladding , all the elaborate scaffolding of commentaries built up around it with such labour and devotion from the ninth century onwards , can seem only to add to the voyager's sense of being lost upon a darkling ocean If it did not come from God , then what might its origins have been Answers to this , over the past few decades , have become increasingly various – nor as yet , among western scholars , is there any sign of a consensus ""' Qu'ranic studies , as a field of academic research , appears today to be in a state of disarray ' : such is the frank admission of Fred Donner , Professor of Near Eastern History at Chicago and the doyen of early Islamic studies ""' Those of us who study Islam's origins ' , he has confessed , ' have to admit collectively that we simply do not know some very basic things about the Qu'ran – things so basic that the knowledge of them is usually taken for granted by scholars dealing with other texts . ' Its place of origin , its original form , its initial audience – all are mysteries That being so , it is certainly no longer possible to presume that there is anything remotely self-evident about the birth of Islam Forty years ago any querying what Muslim tradition taught about its own origins might have been dismissed as mere crankish troublemaking of a kind that no more merited a response from heavyweight experts than did , say , the attempt to ascribe Shakespeare's plays to Francis Bacon or the Earl of Oxford All that has changed Indeed it is hard to think of any other field of history so currently riven by disagreement as is that of early Islam Fortunately , amid all the confusion and obscurity , of one thing at least we can be confident : Islam did not originate in a total vacuum Of the world into which Muhammad was born , with its rival superpowers and its formidable array of monotheisms , we are most decidedly not ignorant To compare the would-be universal dominions of Persia and Rome with the empire that the caliphate became , or to trace echoes of Jewish and Christian writings in the Qu'ran , is to recognise that Islam , far from spelling the end of what had gone before , seems in many ways to have been its culmination ""' What is the reason that God has delivered you into our hands ? ' So the convalescing ' Son of Ishmael ' demanded of the monk of Beth Hale The question was one that Christians in turn , in the centuries before Muhammad , had demanded of Jews and pagans The story of how Islam came to define itself and to invent a model of the past that would sanction such a definition , is only part of a much broader story : one that is ultimately about how Jews , Christians and Muslims all came by their understanding of their respective religions Whether any of them truly derived from the intervention within human history of a god is not for the historian to say But look at the brilliance and inventiveness of the civilisations into which they were born and it is certainly possible to recognise in all of them the authentic stamp of mortal agency The vision of God to which both rabbis and bishops subscribed and that Muhammad's followers inherited did not emerge from nowhere The monotheisms that became state religions from the Atlantic to central Asia had ancient , unexpected , roots To trace them is to cast a searchlight across the entire civilisation of antiquity "

He told me that his attorney advised him not to have "" black people "" in the courtroom , saying that "" their "" presence might negatively affect the jury's decision Although my friend was shocked , he eventually recognized that perhaps the attorney was simply looking out for his client's well-being My friend had only reluctantly shared the attorney's comment with me and he made it clear that I was welcome to do whatever I preferred I too was shocked , taken aback , even a little hurt Nevertheless it seemed like the most important thing was to do what was best for my friend I decided we would stop attending I did not want our presences to distract the attorney As it turned out , another mutual friend , also black , came to the courtroom the following week I had suggested that my friend share his attorney's comment with Chloe , but he chose not to At one point the attorney turned to my friend , his client , and asked , "" Who's this ? He responded , "" That's my friend Chloe I have black friends What can I say ? My mother grew up in Haiti , where she never experienced full-on racism I am grateful that she has mostly been spared from experiencing it here in the U . S . as well I decided not to tell my mother the real reason we weren't going back to the courtroom "
0,"Student protestors at Princeton want Woodrow Wilson's head to roll , and apparently the New York Times agrees , calling him "" an unapologetic racist . Students elsewhere have garnered national attention calling for changes on campuses At Princeton they demand that the university change the name of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs because Wilson segregated the federal civil service and demoted or dismissed African American officials But is this the best way to deal with such an egregious legacy Wilson is hardly the only figure to become a source of controversy At Yale it's John C . Calhoun , and at the University of Texas it's Jefferson Davis Others may yet become candidates for vilification After all , Andrew Jackson paved the Trail of Tears , Teddy Roosevelt castigated women's education , and FDR interned Japanese Americans The logic of protestor demands would lead to changing names attached to institutions , buildings , and monuments across the country Why not remove slave-owners Thomas Jefferson and George Washington from U . S . currency while we are at it Where does it all end With all of his flaws , Wilson is a part of our past and so are the others We cannot erase our history and its legacy The grave cost of going down this road is forgetting the sins of the past that light the way to a better future on and off campus Hanging onto our history — the good , the bad , and the racist — is a vital source of wisdom about where we have come from , what we have been through , and how we can improve upon the record of institutions that decided to honor historical figures such as these Instead of removing names from schools , residence halls , and monuments we should "" flip "" them by devoting the resources , spaces , and cultural significance they represent to address the enduring problems associated with the historical legacies of their namesakes At Princeton , this could mean making the Wilson School a center for scholarship on inequality and discrimination , at Yale it might take the form of a center for student activism around issues of climate and diversity within the Calhoun residential College At Texas it may mean placing a plaque featuring a critical historical account of slavery and the Civil War alongside the Davis monument There are countless other possibilities for flipping these legacies , and using them for insight about the past and inspiration for a better present and future We are far from perfect as individuals and as a nation Using standards we can scarcely imagine today , future generations will doubtless judge us by the names we honor today In these trying times the rush to expunge the past should not be taken lightly "

S . not to inhabit the universal They are considered too readily not ( fully ) to belong , indeed by some — Dylann Roof said it explicitly to the Charleston nine he murdered — not to belong at all Black people are far too readily denied decent education and employment , stopped and frisked , apprehended , incarcerated , criminalized , animalized , killed Black lives in America are the objects of social suspicion as their constitutive condition , their very being Blacks are presumed to be up to no good , to be no good Black lives are flippantly extinguished , not least by cops , by state representatives , by law and order For no good reason other than being ontologically suspected , the given objects of suspicion It is necessary to insist that "" Black lives matter , "" to shout it out loud , to organize around it because this society provides repeated proof — literally on a daily basis — that in the U .

In particular , black lives matter because of the labor black folk provided on which this country was founded , on whose enslaved suffering the great wealth of the nation was built We are a better humanity because of the deep reflection and insight black intellectuals and artists have provided about what it means to survive in the face of repression , humiliation , and death , from Frederick Douglass and Sojourner Truth to James Baldwin and Toni Morrison Black lives matter because of the exemplification of dignity in the face of its denial , of humanity in the face of humiliation Black humanity matters because of the celebration of life in the face of suffering , and because of the extraordinary contribution to science , letters , culture and arts And , black people matter because blacks have represented the country in the highest of ways while yet being maligned in the most malicious of ways Black lives matter because the struggle for rights , justice , and full citizenship across the history of the U . S . has been America's struggle to fulfill itself , the rights achieved on black backs ultimately the rights of all Frantz Fanon famously contra-posed the notion of racialization — of being reduced to the racist characterizations — to being humanized Black lives matter , in short , because black people continue to exemplify what it means to be human in the face of inhumanity and dehumanization , of living a human life against the constraints of "" racialization , "" in the face of insistent institutional violence and ( social ) death "" Black Lives Matter "" is gathering steam as the compelling human and social rights movement of our time The social movement is surfacing rampant subterranean police violence and discrimination toward black people , serving to hold police accountable for the stream of killings suffered by unarmed and innocent black men , women and children at the hands of officers and their surrogates , and challenging political leadership to realize the full rights of black people in the U .

0,"If you want to really make the world a better place , I recommend you stop thinking about racism Now , before you think of me or this statement as irresponsible , read on For the past five weeks I have been writing this series on racism while working on CITIZEN : An American Lyric , a play about racism written by Claudia Rankine and adapted for the stage by Stephen Sachs As part of this series , last week I wrote Why I Constantly Think About Racism In it I said that racism is inescapable , and it is time to stop trying to distance ourselves from this truth Instead , we must face racism See it And , call it by its name So why on Earth am I now saying we should stop thinking about racism This past weekend during a talk-back with CITIZEN author Claudia Rankine , a woman asked , What can we do as individuals Other people that weekend had voiced the same question There was no definitive answer produced The process of eating an elephant one bite at a time crossed my mind Einstein said you cannot change a problem with the same thinking that created it Likewise , when it comes to racism , we cannot change it by thinking about it in the same old ways ; too often we get caught up in the intellectual debate — discussing injustice , assigning blame — and trying to prove , sometimes desperately , that we are NOT racist At the Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles , I'm told there are two doors with signs that read "" racists "" and "" non-racists . I am also told that very few people enter through the door marked racist I assume this means most people don't see themselves as racist But in fact we all behave in ways that keep racism alive These past five weeks of looking through the lens of CITIZEN , along with 300 - plus years of history , confirm that racism is too big a topic to go up against in the same old way Its size and historical strength are just too overwhelming However , we as individuals can start deconstructing racism — not by attacking it in the world , but rather by becoming aware of our everyday unconscious behaviors that fuel racism , and all the other - isms that corrupt our personal humanity This is the "" What can I do , "" action that CITIZEN suggests We must accept that racism is intricately woven into the human experience and American culture We all are both victims and perpetrators Once we understand this truth , we can stop wasting our time with blaming Instead , we can learn to take pride in catching ourselves in the act of old behavior , and make new choices As we learn to see and change our behavior , we can each experience a sense of accomplishment This becomes a profound way to take both responsibility and new , effective action Such accomplishments are the byproducts of developing inner fitness — the strength and ability to change and manage life from the inside It is easy to see racism when it shows up as it did in South Carolina , Auschwitz , or as Japanese-American Internment It is not as easy to see the subtle practice of racism that is represented by the surprise that a black person is articulate ; a Latin person drives a nice car ; an Asian person struggles with common emotional issues ; a white person uses food stamps Generalities are a breeding ground for racism As a starting place for real change , let's take our attention off of the intellectual debate Instead , as Einstein instructs , think differently Make a pact with yourself to observe yourself in the next week and month Throughout each day , see how often you generalize , lump together , and collectively label people When we experience one person from another race and assume that they represent their entire race , it's not just racist It is also profoundly insulting and dismissive Lumping people together means you don't care about who they really are You are not interested in getting to know them If we don't take time to engage with one another , we can never dispel the erroneous assumptions we constantly make , based upon our ignorance of other people and cultures Nor can we confront our irrational fears of others Lumping people together robs you of intimacy and humanity The cost we pay is the development of a shallow heart Shallow hearts do not have the strength and resilience necessary to make a difference Once we learn to take charge of what takes place inside of us , we each become a more powerful , capable and effective force in the world As we go forward from here , my intention is to suggest ways we all can make a difference by thinking differently , changing our hearts , and making our own lives more emotionally rich and free For now , you can start by not thinking about racism and instead paying attention to the assumptions and generalities you carry in your heart "

Bilal and Jamila were very surprised to see a jinn They were so surprised that they almost fell off their beds "" Why are you here ? Bilal bravely asked "" I have come to tell you about the purpose of Ramadan and Eid , "" Assad said And , right after that they were whisked away You see , jinns travel very fast - before you even blink they can go around the world So , it was very much like a roller-coaster ride to the two twins Assad took them to a street in which poor people lived The two twins almost cried ( although Bilal didn't like to admit it ) to see that many of the people were starved "" See , one reason why Muslims fast is so that they can appreciate the food that Allah has given them and to know what it feels like for less unfortunate people , "" Assad stated Then , before you could even say "" Hi "" , the friendly jinn took them to a mosque The people were praying to Allah and thanking Him "" We also fast , because it purifies ourselves and helps us to become better Muslims . Assad said "" Then we can go to heaven , INSHALLAH ! Jamila said with a dreamy look That is the best reward that Muslims should work hard for Then , Assad asked them , "" Can one of you think of another reason why we're supposed to fast ? "" I know I know ""It's healthy for us ! , Bilal said jumping up and down Jamila then looked at him with a warning glance because he was jumping around like a kangaroo "" You are correct , Bilal ""It's good for our bodies instead of always stuffing our faces with food ! Jamila then started giggling about them stuffing their food in their mouths at dinnertime Did Assad know about that "" And of course , we celebrate Eid Al-Fitr to mark the end of Ramadan People give presents to each other on this day , pray at the mosque , and spend time with friends and family . Jamila and Bilal then started thinking and eagerly waiting for the next day It was so hard to wait "" Well , this was the purpose of your trip I will now take you back to your beds so you can get a good night's sleep before Eid ! In an instant , the two twins were taken to their room and they yawned sleepily They promised to each other to keep this adventure a secret "

0,"The Aligarh Muslim University organized a two-day International Conference on April 6-7 under the aegis of the Centre for Promotion of Educational and Cultural Advancement of Muslims of India ( CEPECAMI ) It was the first of its kind of seminar to analyse the Muslim situation and find out the factors and reason that have led to disarray in and decline of the community and caused schisms among them The conference was held in a situation when the thought process among the Muslims shows all symptoms of being moribund and a paralysis afflicts the intelligentsia It was aimed at opening the channels of communication within the community Prof . Rashid Shaz , Director , CEPECAMI and noted author and thinker was the convener The Conference drew nearly 200 delegates , 40 of them from destinations abroad and outside Aligarh in India We report below excerpts from welcome address by Prof . Rashid Shaz , Presidential address by Vice Chancellor Lt . Gen . Zameeruddin Shah and a few other important speakers : Every crisis presents an opportunity The present crisis gives us an opportunity to reflect what went wrong There have been wars , social and political wars Iran-Iraq war , the two Gulf Wars have taken huge toll of human lives Now Yemen is under the throes of war Something terrible has happened to the world of Islam We need to probe what really ails the Muslim mind We need to know where exactly lies the rot and how to stem it Twentieth century was consumed in maintaining bipolarity It was the bloodiest in the history One percent of the world's population is controlling the world's entire wealth The United State's war on terror was to camouflage its intention and design to control energy resources We must stop this bloodshed Some disturbing question stare into our face : Who are we Are we some sects Why should we identify ourselves as Shia , Sunni , Barelvi , Deobandi etc It amounts to blasphemy , shirk ( polytheism ) We are destroying ourselves with internecine conflict We must not allow the women to be powerless The Aligarh Muslim University is playing a stellar role to bridge the gap knowledge Around 40 % of the students are women Our students should tell others the inclusiveness that pervades here We are a crisis nation and since our crisis has global ramifications , we are looked at as a source of all crises This contemporary image of ours is quite contrary to the Quranic image wherein we are portrayed as Khaire Ummah , the chosen people of God raised specifically to enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong Contrary to our Quranic image , we are a nation in ruins From Iraq to Syria and further down to Lebanon , from posh urban centers in Pakistan to the rugged hills of Afghanistan , and from the devastated lands of Libya and Egypt to Yemen , Muslims are pitted against fellow Muslims Imagine the chaos Muslims are bombing Muslims They are flying drones against fellow Muslims The Ummah of the last prophet is on a suicide spree We are facing an Islamic meltdown The Muslim world is being depopulated and at an alarming rate According to a conservative estimate , the two wars in Iraq and the sanctions in between has claimed a million lives A civil war has gripped the neighbouring Syria where some 250,000 people have perished so far Eleven million of the country's 22 million people had to leave their homes , of them four million have taken refuge in neighboring countries Some 10 million people inside Syria do not have enough to eat Imagine the scale of devastation Muslims are killing Muslims , and with the help of foreign weapons and advisors , has become such a huge and established industry that today we have specific websites devoted to counting our dead bodies Taliban and other sectarian groups have created havoc in Pakistan Afghanistan , which lost 1.5 million Muslims during the Afghan Jihad , has become a festering wound Now , an all-out war is raging in Yemen And there are all indications that the flames of war will spill over to the entire region A Shia-Sunni sectarian frenzy lies at the heart of the conflict Make no mistake It is our internal contradiction that allows others to occupy our lands , grab our resources , dishonor our women , kill our children , and depopulate our villages They hire us for our own killing Call it sunni al-Qaeda or Shei Hezbollah , or be they Taliban or Da'esh , Jaish al-Mahdi or Sipah Sahaba We Muslims are strange mercenaries hired to kill our own sons and daughters This is sheer madness , cannibalism of the worst kind The rise and fall of a nation is no big deal But extinction of the Muslim Ummah is no ordinary concern They are the upholders of the last message of God to the humanity Simply put , they are the continuing legacy of all the prophets and seers , and by virtue of being deputies of the last prophet they have been entrusted to lead history till end times We acquired ungodly identities , gave in to sectarian loyalties Today the agony that we are in is God's judgment on us who had very clearly warned us : "" Verily , as for those who have broken the unity of their faith and have become sects – thou hast nothing to do with them Behold , their case rests with God : and in time He will make them understand what they were doing "" To get back to the God's abounding mercy once again , we need to return to the fold of original Islam , the fold of one Ummah Today , the Muslim mind is terribly confused A vast gap exists between what the Quran enjoins and what our sectarian preachers and cult leaders preach The crisis is a reflection of the crisis in the Muslim mind We know of the Sykes-Picot treaty , a secret deal that fragmented the world of Islam into many nation states leaving no room for any future unification of the Ummah , but we are not aware of the many ideological , fiqhi and maslaki Sykes-Picots that took root in course of time , which have become sacrosanct and thus have made any future unification of the Ummah impossible A new beginning cannot be made unless we reopen the Book of God and let God's voice speak to us without any human mediation Remember Islam is a gift of God to humanity It is our collective heritage If it gets blurred or adulterated it is everybody's concern We cannot leave it to any group of specialists or clergy to tell us what God really wants from us In Islam everybody is his own pope Our Prophet came to liberate us from the shackles of clergy This conclave is for collective introspection The conference is a befitting tribute to our beloved founder who always used his head for hard thinking and rarely as a cap-stand To quote Iqbal : "" Sir Syed Ahmed was the first Indian Muslim who felt the need of a fresh orientation of Islam and worked for it We may differ from his religious views , but there can be no denying the fact that his sensitive soul was the first to react to the modern age The extreme conservatism of Indian Muslims which had lost its hold on the realities of life failed to see the real meaning of the religious attitude of Syed Ahmad . A paradox characterizes the Muslim in the current world If we are chosen ones , why cannot we arrest the decline We have ben undergoing for eight centuries We have all the resources but then why the crisis Duality of duniya ( worldly life ) and Aakhira ( life after death ) seeps the Muslim mind The Quran strikes a fine balance by using the two words in equal number i . e . , 115 times Knowledge was indivisible Quran laid a ndew framework of knowledge Islam wanted man to explore the Nature not to worship No other holy lays so much stress on tadabbur ( strategy ) , tafakkur ( contemplation ) and ta'aqqul ( wisdom ) But we abandoned reasoning All best intellectuals survived or thrived till 10th century The situation was such till then that if you did not know Arabic , you will not be recruited in any universities Teachers of Roger Bacon's ( father of modern science ) were all Arabs But then we declined as we gave up contemplation The Taquiuddin Observatory in Istanbul was demolished dubbing it as the source of plague , hence the reason for inviting the curse of God Reasoning and revelation are two sides of the same coin If you do not question , no solution will emerge Newton and James Watt questioned what they saw and experienced Let us question as to what happened to us in history Ijtihaad is the catalyst for Islam's resurgence The holy Prophet stressed on reasoning We should develop rational thinking There should be no hesitation from learning from other when we do not possess knowledge ""Didn't the Prophet ask the non-believers taken captive in the Battle of Badr to seek their release by imparting literacy to illiterate Muslims Muslims ruled this land for 550 years but could not conquer the hearts of the local people At the end of their rule , only 20 % of the people of India were Muslims Muslims only ruled , they did not do Allah's work Only non-violence has succeeded in India Do not think of anything that hurts people Muslims have abandoned the Prophet's approach to people with love , no revenge His general amnesty on the cnqeust of Makkah is a model for the entire humanity How beautifully the Quran puts it : Whoever killed an innocent person , he killed the entire humanity And anyone who saved one from being killed , it is as if he imparted life to the entire humanity Nothing can happen in this world without commitment , passion If your commitment is weak , there will be hesitation on your part If you fail , do not blame others We are at the crossroads of history We had lousy hundred years Let us not cheat ourselves by just thinking of Aakhirah Let us live our life fully Fox News has made a particular image of Muslims in the United States It took Himalayan patience on my part as a panelist and some years to convince the anchor Shaun to change the idiom from ' Radical Muslims ' to ' Radicals among Muslims ' I have been the only panelist among 20 of them who was not a right-winger The power of engagement should be such that people should not hate you You will see that your presence will dilute what others say Muslim ummah is in critical urgency of intellectual growth for which educationa institutions can play a role by making both teachers and students revisit and rediesgn the religious studies , including Tafsir studies Tafsir is a sacred task It needs highly careful and deeply conscious approach on the part of mufassirun The four principles of Quranic interpretation ( 1 - The Quran interprets the Quran , 2 - the prophetic traditions elaborate the Quran , 3 - views of the companions and the successors unfold the Quran , and 4 - Judeo-Christian traditions help understand the historical narrative in the Quran ) remains sofar undefined and unspecified as to their scope and modes Hence those principles need to be defined The Tafsir works have so far created schisms among Muslims In order forge unity among Muslims , the Quran is to be be interpreted appropriately in the light of the Quran , the most reliable traditions and intellectual acts , tadabbur , tafakkur , ta'aqqul , tadhakkur and tahassun Universities and colleges in the Muslim world need to introduce a new subject "" critical analysis of Tafsir methodology "" or include critical dimension in the already available subject Manahij al-Mufassirun Muslims are a disunited lot today Their societies are wracked by civil wars , feuds , displacement of people , militancy , terrorism , gender disparity , famine , illiteracy , unemployment and corruption All vital indices of development are negative Yet the rhetoric "" Islam means Peace "" rents the air Peace does not mean absence of war , but it implies availability of justice Colonial rulers created Muslim states without any regard to historical , ethnic , religious homogeneity and propped up dictators all across them The Islamic opponents of these regimes were uncouth and bereft of of any modern vision Now the West finds it convenient to stall democracy in the Muslims world by kicking up the chimera of militant and primordial khilafat and Islam The seven decades of independence have not really brought any cheer for Muslims in the Muslim countries even while within the same period China became a thriving economy and India grew up as a thriving democracy Germany and Japan wriggled out of the shadows of the past Muslims tend to idealize the past as glorious , authentic , perfect and desirable Internally , taboos abound within Islam and ever new anathemas add to the misery of the people and made the entire populations uncreative Speeches extol rationalism of Islam but when it comes to practice , reverence of conventions rules the roost They take no cognizance of pluralism , nation-state , secularism , social complexity of new nations The essence of the Quranic values such as truthfulness , justice , accountability , transparency eludes the Muslim societies Women are subordinated and excluded from vital spheres of collective life They show extreme resistance to change , inasmuch as Muslim youth in democratic societies or the new converts themselves turn away from Islam The holy Quran was the main fulcrum of Islamic teachings But the axis gradually shifted to traditions of the Prophet , and then to Fiqh and then again to opinion of specific imams But there is hardly any attempt and effort to creatively interpret the traditions and old formulas It is time Muslims engaged themselves in thoughtful and courageous interpretation of the sacred text and carry forward the principled enshrined in them , rather than the old formulas which are out of sync of the new circumstances "

0,"Moustafa Bayoumi is a professor of English at Brooklyn College , where I teach political science His book , "" This Muslim American Life , "" came out in September ""It's a fascinating collection of pieces — sometimes hilarious , often unsettling , always probing and provocative — about , well , Muslim life in America , past and present ""There's a mini-memoir about the time Moustafa worked as a Middle Eastern extra on "" Sex and the City 2 ″ ; a Philip-Roth-like story about his discovery of a terrorist named Mustafa Bayoumi in a detective novel ( that really did happen ); a loving deconstruction of the Islamic undertones and overtones of John Coltrane's music ( "" A Love Supreme "" becomes "" Allah Supreme "" ); a harrowing essay on how the American military uses music to terrorize and torture its victims ( the phrase "" Disco Inferno "" takes on a whole new meaning ); a long and learned history of the relationship between Muslim Americans and African Americans The book ranges widely , but it's held together by a single premonition : that the wrenching changes of the War on Terror have been not only legal and political but also cultural They are not confined to foreign policy or domestic policing ; they extend to the most intimate and personal spaces of social life They have created among all of us — Muslim and non-Muslim alike — a new set of experiences and sensibilities , a new sense of community and collectivity At the same time , Moustafa's book is a long , sustained insistence that we understand all the ways in which people — particularly Muslim people — live their lives outside the War on Terror "" This Muslim American Life "" documents the oozing influence of the state , but with its sense of humor and history , shows just how much of the Muslim American experience lies beyond that influence A literary critic and gifted essayist , Moustafa brings his formidable skills as a reader of texts to his analysis of contemporary political culture ""He's got that eye — and ear — for the way our most incidental phrases , those stray bits of language , betray our deepest feelings Where other books on the War on Terror focus on high acts of state , Moustafa finds his materials in the most unexpected places : yes , in the fine print of a legal statute , but also in standup comedy , in the parables of Kafka , in the penultimate paragraph of newspaper article His archive is everywhere Moustafa and I have been friends for years , and we've often talked over drinks or dinner , on campus and in caf és , about the topics he addresses in his book But it wasn't till I sat down with "" This Muslim American Life "" that I truly saw the unity of his vision So I decided to do what we always do when either of us has a book or an idea we're excited about : sit down with him and talk about it Why did you write "" This Muslim American Life "" American society hasn't really grappled with the way that it has changed during the War on Terror We now live in an age of permanent war , and that war has justified everything from the government spying on its citizens ( NSA surveillance ) to the CIA torturing its detainees We have adopted innovative forms of warfare ( drones ) and incarceration ( Guantanamo Bay ) without thinking through their consequences And Muslim Americans are collectively caricatured , blamed and discriminated against , both by the public and by policy One way of thinking about these changes is to consider what I call a "" War on Terror culture . When we think of the Cold War , we think of the constant war-footing in American culture , the stereotypical images of people from the Soviet Union , even of a kind of palette of colors ( The FX show "" The Americans "" plays with this brilliantly . Cold War culture changed the legal landscape of the country It stoked our paranoia and drove our foreign policy It influenced our novelists , painters , poets and filmmakers And all of these fields — legal , political , entertainment — fed off of each other to create a broader Cold War culture I think we see something similar operating right now , which we haven't come to terms with But War on Terror culture is also different from Cold War culture For one thing , there are 3 to 6 million Muslims living in this country today , and they feel the brunt of War on Terror culture directly ""That's different than during the Cold War , when the number of people in the United States from the Soviet Union was smaller and many had come as ideological dissidents War on Terror culture also imagines Muslims in ideological terms , but it often further casts them as fundamentally dangerous because of their cultural , ethnic and religious ties as well You said that when we think about Cold War culture , there's a set of stock images and even colors What are the images or colors of War on Terror culture A lot of screaming beards And hijabs ""It's comprised of images of Muslims as either victims or villains , and really nothing in between This is a theme in your book , images of Muslims as victims or villains but nothing in between How does that work Take myself as an example I have nothing to do with terrorism Nobody I know has anything to do with terrorism And yet , all Muslim life in America is seen through the lens of terrorism So either you are a victim of this war or you are villain who is responsible for it Like everybody else , Muslims live their lives in complex ways But when you see a Muslim character on a television show , you can bet the story will be about national security "
0,"Around 190 Muslim workers at a meatpacking plant in Fort Morgan , Colorado were fired last month after walking off the job in protest of management's discriminatory decision to revoke prayer breaks during their shift The Colorado plant , operated by multinational food giant Cargill , employs around 2,100 hourly workers Six hundred of these , or more than one-quarter , are Muslim refugees from Somalia , one of the world's poorest countries , which has been decimated by decades of conflict stoked by American imperialism The salah , or praying five times a day , is one of the main pillars of the Islamic faith The prayers , which generally take no more than five minutes , take place at regular intervals throughout the day , which are determined by the movement of the sun across the sky The workers involved in the walkout all worked on the plant's second shift , which falls during sundown prayers Management at the plant opened up a small prayer area on the premises to accommodate the workers in 2009 However , workers who have sought to utilize the space during their working hours have reported that they have been subjected to routine threats from management "" This has been going on for a long time , "" Jaylani Hussein of the Council on American-Islamic Relations ( CAIR ) , which is representing the fired workers in the dispute , told the press "" There have been instances last year and this year where supervisors would literally say , ' You're fired , you're going home , ' if you go to pray . Matters reportedly came to a head in December when the new manager for the second shift prohibited prayer breaks during work hours Ten Muslim workers resigned the following day , followed shortly by a walkout by around 200 more Cargill responded by firing all of the roughly 190 workers who had not returned to work on December 29 , citing a clause in their union contract that provides for summary dismissal after three consecutive unexcused absences Mike Martin , a spokesman for Cargill , denied that the company had banned prayer breaks and blamed the walkout on a "" misunderstanding . He told the media the initial resignations came after the company refused a request by 11 workers to leave the production line in order to pray at the same time Company policy , according to Martin , allows only two or three workers to leave at a time in order to keep the line moving "" While reasonable efforts are made to accommodate employees , accommodation is not guaranteed every day and is dependent on a number of factors that can , and do , change from day to day . However , the workers say this request was never made "" They told us , ' If you try [ to pray ] tomorrow , you're going to get a write-up or get fired , ' "" plant worker Mahmoud Hassan told the local ABC affiliate However , even by Martin's own favorable characterization , Cargill's policy would likely be a violation of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act , which prohibits employers from discriminating against employees on the basis of religion Under the law , employees ' requests for a "" reasonable accommodation "" for their religious beliefs must be met as long as it does not place an "" undue hardship "" on business operations For example , a worker can request not to be scheduled to work during the Sabbath if it goes against his religious practices Since the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , American Muslims have reported a sharp rise in workplace discrimination One 2013 study by Carnegie Mellon University found that Muslim job applicants received callbacks for interviews at far lower rates than Christians , especially in conservative states The federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has also reported a sharp rise in religious-based discrimination cases reported by Muslims after 2001 , doubling in 2002 and peaking at 884 in 2011 American Muslims , who comprise two percent of the population , account for nearly a quarter of all such discrimination cases Negotiations with the company by CAIR to have the workers re-instated have thus far led nowhere According to company policy , workers who were terminated are not allowed to re-apply for six months ; the CAIR negotiating team is reportedly attempting to have this freeze waived Significantly , the union that claims to represent the workers , Teamsters Local 455 , has done nothing to defend the victimized workers The local has not even acknowledged the firings on their web site or Facebook page , and has reportedly refused to talk to CAIR , to whom the workers ' turned after the union's inaction Many workers at the plant earn as little as $ 14 per hour , barely above the official poverty level for a family of four David Macary , a former union bureaucrat who denounced the World Socialist Web Site on the Counterpunch web site for mobilizing opposition against the betrayal by the United Auto Workers in the recent contract struggle , accused the meatpacking workers of demanding "" preferential treatment "" in a recent column Evincing filthy "" America-first "" chauvinism , which is the stock-in-trade of the unions , Macaray asked , "" Why have ICE agents chased out undocumented Latinos in these meat-packing plants and opened the door to Somalis Why aren't more American-born men and women working these $ 30,000 a year jobs ? The mass firings in Colorado are similar to an earlier incident in Nebraska in 2008 when roughly 90 mostly Somali Muslims at a meatpacking plant operating by JBS Swift & Co . were fired after walking off the job in protest after being refused prayer breaks during Ramadan , the Islamic holy month The United Food and Commercial Workers Union , which represented the workforce at the plant , refused to support the workers , and the local union president falsely claimed to the press that the workers had "" quit . Far from opposing xenophobic and anti-Muslim agitation , the unions function as accomplices in the efforts by the corporate and political establishment to use the "" war on terror "" to divide the working class , carry out sweeping attacks on the democratic rights of all workers and justify ever-expanding wars "

0,"Recorded hate crimes against Muslims and Jews have soared in the past year , with offences against Muslims spiking by 171 per cent in November following the Paris attacks , new Metropolitan Police figures have revealed In the 12 months to November , the number of Islamophobic crimes recorded was 818 - 63.9 per cent higher than the 499 crimes recorded in the year to November 2014 In the month of November alone , there were 163 Islamophobic offences recorded compared to just 60 in November 2014 The Paris attacks took place on November 13 In the same period , 483 anti-Semitic crimes were recorded , a 61.5 per cent increase from 299 offences The number of anti-Semitic attacks in November alone was down 53 per cent , recorded at 37 compared to 80 in November 2014 Conservative MP Stuart Andrew , who chairs the Commons all party group on Islamophobia , said recorded offences often spike after a major terrorist attack He said it was important to communicate that Islamophobic attacks were a ' totally unacceptable ' response to He told MailOnline : ' We were sort of expecting it - some of the numbers have shown that after attacks such as Paris we saw rises ""' I also think they are now properly recording it - before it just went down as a generic hate crime . ' Mr Andrew added : ' Without looking at each individual case , it is difficult to assess but my instinct is there is a combination of police doing their work and engaging people to report it but equally it's a response some people make following attacks like Paris . ' Labour MP John Mann , the chairman of the all party group on anti-Semitism , told MailOnline much of the rise had been driven by Twitter and other social media He said : ' It's a significant increase and it's concerning The internet is one of the factors - but not the only one ""' People are now more confident reporting incidents , that's undoubtedly the case ""' The internet has made a big difference over the last two years ... the internet is giving cowards more confidence to be abusive ""It's also helping to connect such people together . ' Mr Mann said he had no criticism of the police and the way such offences were handled He added : ' My big criticism is of the internet companies who are not providing information to the police to allow them to look into incidents . ' A Metropolitan Police spokesman said : ' We are acutely aware that all areas of hate crime are still under reported and we are encouraged that more people feel confident to report racial and religious hate crimes , regardless if this is direct to Police or via a third party or online ""' The Met is committed to tackling hate crime in all its forms and we have long since recognised the impact of hate crime on communities and victims of hate crime must be assured that they will be taken seriously by the police ""' We have more than 900 specialist officers across London working in our Community Safety Units who are dedicated to investigating hate crime ""' We take positive action to investigate all hate crime allegations , support victims and their families and bring perpetrators to justice .

0,"Anas , a close Companion of Prophet Muhammad ( peace and blessings be upon him ) reported , "" A Jewish woman brought a poisoned lamb to the Prophet , and he ate of it When the woman was brought to him , people suggested , ' Shall we kill her ? ' The Prophet said , ' No . ' I have recognized the effects of that poisoning in the Prophet's throat ever since . ( Al-Bukhari , Muslim , Abu Dawood , Ahmad , and others ) Following the Prophet's example in any situation is to make sure of choosing the right course of action Some people may think that this applies to matters of religion only In Islam there is no differentiation between religious and "" worldly "" matters Everything in people's lives is evaluated from the Islamic viewpoint Hence the Prophet's example provides guidance to us in all spheres of life It is needless to say that this applies , in perhaps greater measure , to social behavior and relations with other people It is important to study how the Prophet treated other people in a comprehensive range of situations in order to understand the Islamic approach to social relations Here , we are giving a few brief notes on one characteristic that manifested itself in the Prophet's behavior in a variety of situations That characteristic is forgiveness of one's enemies Perhaps the description "" a personal enemy "" cannot be attached more appropriately than to one who tries to kill someone When the attempt is the result of careful plotting , then the hostility is deeply rooted During his life , the Prophet had many enemies who plotted against his life One such attempt took place soon after the Prophet won the battle of Khaibar that he fought against the Jews of Madinah , resulting in the destruction of the Jewish military power in Arabia Khaibar fell to the Prophet after a long siege culminating in a fierce fighting to win several of the many forts of which this Jewish stronghold consisted In order to appreciate the significance of the story quoted in the hadith at hand , we have to remember that the Prophet was the head of the Islamic state , in addition to his being a Prophet and a messenger from Allah to all humankind In any state , an attempt on the life of the president or monarch is always viewed very seriously Anyone caught making or preparing to make such an attempt is normally charged with high treason and with making an aggression on the state and all its people Such a person hardly ever escapes the death penalty Yet the immediate reaction of the Prophet was that the woman must not be killed Moreover , there was no question about the identity of the perpetrator of that ghastly attempt on the life of the Prophet The woman herself brought the lamb and told the Prophet that she had prepared it as a present to him When the woman was brought before the Prophet , he asked her about her motives She did not deny having poisoned the lamb She said , "" I thought that if you were truly a Prophet , you would not be harmed If you were a king ( meaning that if his claim to prophethood was false ) , then I would have rid people of you . When that woman contemplated her attempt , she must have realized that if she were to be successful , she would have avenged the defeat of her people She was certain that the Prophet accepted any gift given to him and always tried to please the person who gave him a gift by eating from it if it was food or using it if it was something to be used Moreover , she realized that the Prophet would not be the only one to eat of that lamb Any of his Companions who would be attending with him would be invited to join him in his meal Quite a number of them , probably some of the leading figures , would die with him That could very well have been the outcome of her attempt Indeed one of them , Bishr ibn Al-Baraa ' was the first to eat The Prophet himself ate one or two bites He immediately signaled his Companions to stop He told them , "" Do not touch it One of its organs is telling me that it is poisoned . Bishr ibn Al-Baraa ' soon died The Prophet himself complained of the effects of the poison for the rest of his blessed life Anas , who continued in the Prophet's service for 10 years until he passed away , was able to recognize the change that affected the Prophet as a result of this poisoned lamb She must have used a very powerful poison to produce such a lasting effect It is indeed reported that the Prophet said during his illness , just before passing away , that he continued to complain from the poisoned food he ate at Khaibar For this reason , a number of scholars have argued that the Prophet was also a martyr That means that Allah has given him the honor of being a martyr in addition to the honor of being a Prophet and a messenger In the light of the foregoing , the Prophet's tendency to forgive that woman , which was manifested in his immediate reaction to the suggestion of his Companions that they should kill her , is highly significant He always forgave even the most hardened of his enemies , if the choice to forgive was his In this case , it was his own life that was the immediate target of that woman Allah foiled her attempt and the Prophet was inclined to forgive her Most hadiths and history books give this report the same as it has been given in this article They do not mention whether the woman , who incidentally , was called Zainab bint Al-Harith , was punished in anyway Indeed , Al-Bukhari includes this hadith in his highly valuable compilation entitled Al-Adab Al-Mufrad under the chapter heading "" Forgiveness of other People . It is mentioned , however , by a number of scholars that the Prophet subsequently ordered that the woman be executed There is no contradiction between his earlier forgiveness of her and subsequent punishment The Prophet first pardoned her for making an attempt on his life Her attempt failed and he survived He himself was the only one who had the authority to forgive her , since the attempt was made on him personally Her punishment was for killing one of his Companions ( i . e Bishr ibn Al-Baraa ' ) who ate of the poisoned lamb It is well known in Islam that no one , not even the Prophet , has the authority to waive punishment when one of the crimes for which a particular punishment is prescribed by Almighty Allah Himself One of these is murder , which earns capital punishment Once it is established beyond doubt that a certain person has committed a murder , no one may pardon or reduce such person's punishment This applies to all similar crimes such as theft , adultery , and highway robbery This means that while the Prophet was always prepared to pardon an offender who might try to injure or kill him , he could not pardon a murderer , because it is the responsibility of the head of the state to make sure that Allah's law is implemented When it came to personal injury , harm , or insult , the Prophet never hesitated to pardon such offenders The Prophet pardoned the Jewish woman for plotting to assassinate him She was , however , executed for poisoning to death one of his Companions "

Hafsah , his wife , said : "" Yes , messenger of God , they will God says in the Quran what means : { There is not one among you who shall not pass over it ( hell ) . } ( Maryam 19:71 ) Prophet Muhammad said to her : "" But then God follows that by saying : { We shall save those who are God-fearing , and leave the wrongdoers there , on their knees . } ( Maryam 19:72 ) "" ( Muslim , 2496 "
0,"Moon sightings vs . astronomical calculations ; differing fiqh opinions ; multiple madhabs ; sects galore We , as Muslims , seem to cling to reasons to separate But if we put all our differences and opinions aside and really look at Islam , we can find a million more reasons to unite In fact , Islam doesn't only give us cause to unite , it lays out the framework in how to do so I have often thought to myself all this division isn't right and wished I could do something about it Then I decided it was a problem bigger than me However , this was defeatist thinking - - because the problem isn't bigger than me Each of us has the power to build peace in our own community It is not just a matter for leaders If we don't start from the ground up , by dismissing the belief obtaining peace is impossible and bigger than us , any measure towards peace our respective leaders take will not be effective Peacebuilding starts on the individual level Difference isn't the End of the World The first thing we must remember is everyone we meet will have a different opinion than us Everyone approaches Islam with their own perspective , understanding , and experiences And all this will result in different opinions Does this mean you cannot be a good brother or sister to a fellow Muslim who thinks differently Does difference mean the death of cooperation Absolutely not Shaykh Abdullah Bin Bayyah says , "" We must navigate our differences without arrogance or abusive language , with an open mind and the intention of discovering truth rather than winning an argument .

( Muslim ) Brotherhood and Mutual Understanding : Remember that when the Prophet and his companions made hijrah , they became brothers and sisters to one another We , as Muslims , should still be making hijrah together ; yet , not to Madinah , but to Allah Understand that this journey makes us brothers and sisters Even though we are on the same path , we are all experiencing different tests and making different sacrifices , and a little understanding of this can go a long way to bring us together , insha Allah Wisdom : Even knowledge can be used as a weapon to hurt or divide people Knowing the correct way to apply knowledge is wisdom Tarek Ghanem , an OnIslam.net consultant , says : "" The scholars of Islam mention that the best classical definition of hikmah [ wisdom ] is to put things in their due place and portions This definition is of tremendous importance , since , if fully applied , no thought or action can ever be dealt with wisely without incorporating the complete layers of existence , physical and metaphysical , of the here-now and the hereafter , intrinsic and relational that surround .

0,"After his birth , Prophet Muhammad stayed with his mother Amina for a while and then , as per tradition , was handed over to his wet-nurse The purpose of entrusting children to a wet nurse was so that they could be raised in the desert - - a healthier environment in which to grow up when compared to the city - - and so that they could learn fluent Arabic In accordance with this tradition , Prophet Muhammad was given to Halima bint Abi Dhuayb , who was a member of the Sa'd ibn Bakr branch of the Hawazin tribe In a year of famine , Halima had gone to Makka with her husband and other Bedouin women who earned a living through nursing ; however , she was unable to find a child from a rich family to nurse But when she learned that Muhammad had lost his father she did not hesitate to take him , and she agreed to be his wet nurse so that she would not return home empty-handed Halima brought Prophet Muhammad back to Makka two years later ; however , Amina wanted her child to stay with Halima for a little longer , as she believed that the desert air was good for her child and , according to some accounts , there was a plague in Makka Prophet Muhammad stayed with his wet nurse until he was five or six years old and was then brought to Makka and handed over to his mother ""Halima's husband was Harith ibn Abdil ' Uzza The couple's children , ' Abd Allah , Unaysa and Shayma , were the Prophet's foster siblings According to narration , Halima and Harith witnessed great abundance and blessing after taking Prophet Muhammad in their care ; their camels and sheep began to provide much more milk than they had before In addition , the sources reveal that the Splitting of the Chest ( shaqq al-sadr ) incident occurred during the time Prophet Muhammad was staying with his wet nurse This was an event in which two angels descended to earth , split open Muhammad's chest , removed his heart and purified it from all evils , washing it with heavenly water and then putting it back in its place It is recorded that when Halima and Harith learned about this incident they were very anxious as they were unable to explain certain extraordinary characteristics of Muhammad that they had witnessed many times before ; they now thought that it would be better for the child to be back with his family When Prophet Muhammad reached the age of six , his mother Amina took him in her care , and together with her helper Umm Ayman , took him to Yathrib ( Madina ) While there , they visited the grave of her husband ' Abd Allah and the members of the Banu Najjar , who were considered uncles of the family due to ' Abd al-Muttalib's mother After staying in Yathrib for a month Amina , still young at the time , became ill and later died in Abwa - - located 190 km from Madina - - while on the way back to Makka It is said that before her death , Amina looked at her child and said : "" All living things perish All things new get old All things in abundance diminish All things great disappear Certainly I too will die , but I will always be remembered , because I leave to the world my son as a benevolent future . Orphaned with the death of his mother , Muhammad was brought back to Makka by Umm Ayman and entrusted to the care of his grandfather ' Abd al-Muttalib Prophet Muhammad revisited Abwa in the sixth year following the Emigration ( 628 AD ) and visited his mother's grave Tidying the grave with his own hands , he shed tears as he remembered the affection and compassion of his mother Greatly affected by his grief , the Companions could not hold back their tears and cried with him ""' Abd al-Muttalib took great care of Muhammad , as the precious gift from his son ' Abd Allah , who had died at an early age He would sit at the table and eat with Muhammad , offer him the seat of honor located in the shadow of the wall of the Ka'ba , take him to the meetings in Dar al-Nadwa ( Council Hall ) over which he presided , and through all his actions , tried his utmost to ensure that his grandson did not feel the absence of fatherly compassion and love More than eighty years-of-age at the time , ' Abd al-Muttalib passed away not long after he had handed over the custody and protection of his grandson , then eight years-of-age , to the latter's paternal uncle , Abu Talib Abu Talib was born from the same father and mother as the Prophet's father He loved his nephew more than his own children , believing that the child had brought fortune to the family , and he made great efforts to raise him well He would take Muhammad with him on some of his journeys And so , when the Prophet was nine ( or twelve ) years old and his uncle had decided to go to Syria for trade , he wanted to accompany Abu Talib Seeing his nephew's insistence on this , Abu Talib took the Prophet with him on his journey The caravan stopped in Bosra , located in Syria A monk called Bahira , living in a monastery , invited the caravan to join him for a meal After Bahira told Abu Talib that Muhammad was the awaited Prophet foretold in the Bible , he cautioned Abu Talib against some of the dangers that his nephew could face and advised Abu Talib to protect his nephew well Upon this warning , Abu Talib ended his journey and returned to Makka It is known that when Prophet Muhammad was about ten years old he worked as a shepherd for a period of time in order to help his uncle Abu Talib , who had a large family He would later refer to this time during his Prophethood saying , "" There has never been a Prophet who did not herd sheep . When his Companions asked , "" Did you herd sheep O Messenger of God ? he replied , "" Yes I herded the sheep of Makka . Abu Talib's wife Fatima bint Asad took great care of Muhammad , caring for him more than her own children The Prophet never forgot the goodness of his aunt when he grew up He would visit her in her house in Madina and would sometimes sleep there in the afternoons Very grieved when she passed away , the Prophet used his own shirt for her shroud and personally led her funeral prayer When speaking of his sadness to those around him , he showed his great sense of loyalty with the following words : "" I was a child who was in need of her custody She would feed me even if her children were hungry She would leave her children and comb my hair She was like my mother . Abu Talib stood by his nephew after he became a Prophet and although Prophet Muhammad's persistent requests that Abu Talib accept Islam were never answered , Abu Talib did his best to protect Prophet Muhammad , both as a child and later when he became a Prophet There were frequent wars between the Arab tribes in the Age of Ignorance , so much so that there would even be warfare during the sacred months ( Dhu al-Qa'dah , Dhu al-Hijjah , Muharram and Rajab ) during which bloodshed was prohibited Such battles were known as fijar ( sacrilegious ) wars because of their being fought in the sacred months The Prophet was compelled to join such a war in his later teens The most reliable account states that the Prophet and his uncles participated in the great battle that broke out between the Quraysh-Kinanah and Qays-'Aylan alliances , but that he did not actually fight in the war , rather protecting the belongings of his uncles , deflecting arrows with his shield and then collecting them to give to his uncles It is thought that he was either fourteen , fifteen , seventeen or twenty years old at the time Prophet Muhammad participated in a meeting when he was twenty for a league known as the Hilf al-Fudul ( the Alliance of the Virtuous ) The Hilf al-Fudul was drawn up to prevent injustices that were being carried out against the weak and defenseless who came to Makka for pilgrimage or trade , and to prevent the tribal wars that broke out frequently The Hilf al-Fudul was drawn up under the auspices of Zubayr ibn ' Abd al-Muttalib , Prophet Muhammad's uncle , and under the leadership of Jud'an at-Taymi , the richest , oldest and most influential tribal leader in Makka Those who joined the league took an oath that they would protect everyone in Makka who encountered injustice , be they natives or foreigners , acting as one and helping each other financially to ensure that justice was served Prophet Muhammad talked about this alliance , praising it , and said : "" I was present in ' Abd Allah ibn Judan's house when they concluded a pact so excellent that I would not change my part in it even for a herd of red camels ; if I was asked now , in Islam , to take part in it , I would gladly agree . According to an account by Balazuri , in the Islamic period Abu Jahl refused to pay the price of something that he had purchased from a man who was a member of the Arash A polytheist who knew the hostility of Abu Jahl towards the Prophet jokingly told the aggrieved trader that he could apply to the Prophet who was in the Ka'ba and that the Prophet would give him his money back Upon hearing these words , the trader went to the Ka'ba , explained the situation to Prophet Muhammad and asked for his help The Prophet went to Abu Jahl's house and took back the money without any confrontation Prophet Muhammad made his living through trade , like many of the Quraysh in Makka He embarked on his career in trade by helping Abu Talib , who was involved in trading cloth and grain Prophet Muhammad continued this trade when his uncle became older It is known that Prophet Muhammad traveled to various places for purposes of trade , such as to the Hubasha trade fair when he was a teenager , to Yemen once or twice , to the Mushakkar and Daba fairs in eastern Arabia , and even to Abyssinia As a result of these journeys , Prophet Muhammad not only learned about the necessities of commercial life , but also became acquainted with the people living in certain regions of Arabia , and learned about their languages , dialects , religions , and political and social conditions There is consensus among the sources that Prophet Muhammad lived an honest life and remained removed from the wrongdoing prevalent in the Age of Ignorance and came to be known , at the age of twenty-five , as Muhammad al-Amin or Al-Amin ( the Trustworthy ) because of his decency , bravery , compassion , fairness , and his honesty and reliability in commercial life The Makkan trader ' Qays ibn Saib stated that he had many commercial dealings with Prophet Muhammad and that he had never come across a partner in trade who was better than he He said : "" When he set out on a journey , I would refer to him some transactions that needed to be carried out for me After the journey he would not return to his house until he had told me about the transactions in such a way as would make me content In contrast , when I set out on my travels and he gave me some transactions to perform , upon my return he would only ask whether I was healthy and in good spirits , unlike other people , who only questioned me on issues relating to their business .

The Republican Party , while it has a strict anti-abortion platform , including its support of a constitutional amendment banning the procedure , has tried to distance itself from candidates that would turn away women voters During the 2012 presidential election , the issue of birth control and abortion weighed down the Republican primary between Rick Santorum and Mitt Romney Even Santorum , thought to be one of the most socially conservative Republicans in that race , didn't support criminalizing women for abortions He did support criminalizing providers During that same election year , the Republican Party suffered because of down-ballot candidates who espoused extreme positions on the issue Missouri senate candidate Todd Akin spent weeks trying recover after saying rape should not be an exception for abortion because a woman won't get pregnant because her body would "" shut … down . Conservative women are also upset March for Life , an anti-abortion organization , put out a stinging statement in response to Trump "" Mr .

Brian Walsh , Republican strategist who has helped to elect Republicans to the Senate , said a Trump's positions could be problematic for the party "" There's no question that it would be an issue if he's the party's nominee , "" Walsh said Republican down-ballot candidates could expect to be framed in terms like this from spokeswoman of the Democratic National Committee , Christina Freundlich "" In a matter of 24 hours , Trump has gone from defending his campaign manager over charges that he assaulted a woman to now saying women should be ' punished ' for having an abortion Trump is simply reaffirming what the country has known for years - that the Republican Party doesn't stand for women's rights , "" she said After the a flood of negative reaction , including from abortion opponents , Trump reversed his position , but only after two previous attempts to clarify his statement First , Trump's spokeswoman , Hope Hicks , tried to clean up the controversy over abortion after the town hall , releasing a statement "" This issue is unclear and should be put back into the states for determination Like Ronald Reagan , I am pro - life with exceptions , which I have outlined numerous times , "" Trump said in the statement And in a campaign rally in Wisconsin this afternoon , Trump inadvertently tried to address the issue "" Nobody respects women more than me and nobody will be better to woman … nobody but Donald Trump Believe me , "" he said And then , a third attempt , sent just before 5:00 p . m . EST , this complete reversal entered reporters ' inboxes : "" If Congress were to pass legislation making abortion illegal and the federal courts upheld this legislation , or any state were permitted to ban abortion under state and federal law , the doctor or any other person performing this illegal act upon a woman would be held legally responsible , not the woman The woman is a victim in this case as is the life in her womb My position has not changed - like Ronald Reagan , I am pro-life with exceptions . Williams , the Republican strategist , however , said Trump has shown that he's not fit for the Oval Office "" For all these Vichy Republicans out there considering capitulating to Donald Trump , this instance serves as another reminder that it is wrong , "" he said "" Trump needs to be stopped before he somehow gets to the nomination ""We're past the point of no return with him .

There was concern last October when Boko Haram declared its caliphate that the two might team up , but there's no indication that's happening , said the official The groups differ in many ways Both use social media , but the ISIS campaign is much more sophisticated - using more than 20 languages - - and attempts to communicate the Islamic rationale for its operations Boko Haram posts increasingly slick videos on the web , like one released Tuesday that threatens the leaders of Cameroon , Benin and Chad , but its prime recruiting tool is older and simpler than social media "" Boko Haram , "" said one official , "" uses fear .

"" Violence against refugees is pathetic , "" the post says in support of the player "" You belong to us just like anyone else from the Deinster sports club and we are happy that you are with us ! ! ! Europe has a complicated — and controversial — history with blackface German holiday celebrations sometimes blacken the face of one of the Three Wise Men in Christmas pageants The Netherlands , meanwhile , has the holiday character known as "" Black Pete "" — a Christmas tradition activists have been fighting to retire "
0,"After the University of Southern California football team lost to Stanford last Saturday , USC student body president Rini Sampath was lamenting something more than a game "" There's an indescribable hollowness in me , but I'm going public with this because this can't continue , "" Sampath wrote on Facebook the following morning According to Sampath's post , she was walking past a fraternity house Saturday night when someone threw a drink at her and yelled , "" You Indian piece of shit ! Once the person's friends saw it was her , Sampath said , they apologized Sampath , 21 , who immigrated with her family from India to Arizona when she was 6 , said that she was still in shock "" Some people don't believe racism like this can happen on our campus , "" she wrote on Facebook "" Some people continue to doubt the need for safe spaces and the need for expanded cultural resource centers or the need for gender neutral bathrooms or the need for diversity in our curriculum or the need for diversity in our professors or the need for diversity in dialogue And to those who continue to believe we're just playing the ' race ' card , I ask you this — what's there to win here A sense of respect A sense of humanity A sense of love and compassion for others regardless of how they look like ? Varun Soni , USC's Dean of Religious Life , told The Washington Post on Monday that the university had a zero-tolerance policy for that type of behavior , and said he asked Sampath to file a formal complaint on campus Sampath said she still is haunted by the taunt , and the the apology from the fraternity member's brothers failed to make things better "" I couldn't quite figure out why their after-the-fact apologies deepened the wound But one of my friends explained it to me the best this morning : ' Because now you know , the first thing they see you as is subhuman .

0,"For the Los Angeles Police Department , the allegations of departmental corruption and racism by a former police officer now accused of a revenge-fueled killing rampage are the words of a delusional man , detached from the reality of the huge improvements the force has undergone over the years "" These are the rantings of a clearly very sick individual , "" William J . Bratton , a former department commissioner , said Friday "" It would be a shame if he was able to rally to his cause people who remember the bad old days of the L . A . P . D . Yet for whatever changes the department has undergone since the days when it was notorious as an outpost of rampant racism and corruption , the accusations by the suspect — however disjointed and unhinged — have struck a chord They are a reminder , many black leaders said , that some problems remain and , no less significant , that memories of abuses and mistreatment remain strong in many parts of this city "" Our community doesn't need this , "" said the Rev William D . Smart , the president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference of Southern California "" We don't need something like this opening old wounds . "" While there been a lot of improvements , there's still room for improvement , "" he said "" There is still one segment of our community that historically distrusts the police force . Indeed , in posts on Facebook and in interviews , some black residents offered at least a partial endorsement of the sentiments expressed by the suspect , Christopher J . Dorner , in a manifesto posted on his Facebook page , even as they made it clear that they did not condone the violence he is accused of Mr . Dorner , the subject of a manhunt , claimed that racism was a factor in his dismissal from the department in 2008 , and that it was as endemic in the force as ever "" We look at the police differently from the way you look at the police , "" said Hodari Sababu , 56 , a tour guide who has lived in the South Central section of Los Angeles for 40 years "" In your community , the police is there to protect and serve ; in my community , the police are there to harass and to insult and to kill if they get a chance . Charles Hutchinson , 72 , a tennis coach who lives in Los Angeles , said he believed Mr . Dorner's story that he had witnessed a fellow officer kick a suspect Mr . Dorner was dismissed on charges that he had falsified that report "" These things happen all the time , "" he said "" I truthfully think that he was wronged by the Police Department I think that senior officer kicked that homeless guy , they do that all the time . Yet even as he said that , Mr . Hutchinson was quick to add that the situation had improved markedly from the days when William H . Parker III ran a force notorious for profiling and beatings And no matter the lingering perceptions , the evidence reflects that change As Mr . Bratton noted , polls have increasingly shown the department's image has improved across the board , including among blacks and Latinos Whites now make up less than one-third of the force , a sharp turnaround from 30 years ago "" There has been a huge change , "" said Erwin Chemerinsky , a law professor at the University of California , Irvine , who wrote a report on departmental abuses , in an e-mail But , he added , "" It would be naïve and misguided to say that racism in any institution is entirely a thing of the past . Charlie Beck , the police chief , said he did not give any credence to the claims Mr . Dorner made about racism in the department "" You're talking about a homicide suspect who has committed atrocious crimes , "" he said "" If you want to give any attribution to his ramblings on the Internet , go right ahead But I do not . Mr . Dorner was dismissed on the recommendations of a police board that found he had filed a false report claiming to have witnessed a partner kick a homeless man in the process of an arrest Mr . Dorner sought without success to have the court overturn his dismissal Three witnesses to the arrest said that they had not seen the alleged assault ; the father of the homeless person said that his son told him that he had been kicked Chief Beck — and Mr . Bratton , who said he had also reviewed the file — said he had no doubt that Mr . Dorner's dismissal was appropriate "" That case was thoroughly adjudicated ; it was reviewed at multiple levels , "" the chief said at a news conference "" In the final analysis , you'll find Dorner's statements to be self-serving , and the statements of someone who is thoroughly unhappy with his lot in life . Still , in some black neighborhoods , where the case has been followed extremely closely , there was evidence of skepticism about how Mr . Dorner was treated by the department "" Black people feel like we've been targets for so long , we've always felt that the L . A . P . D was corrupt , "" said Kim Pace , 45 , a bus driver from Carson "" So for us , it's like , O . K . , they pushed him over the edge . Mr . Sababu , the tour guide , said the sight of a police officer kicking a suspect was not uncommon in the history of South Central Los Angeles "" Here you have an officer that's actually standing up for a citizen and saying , ' That's wrong , why are you kicking that guy in the face ? ' and for his efforts , he's fired , "" he said Mr . Bratton expressed concern at the fallout of Mr . Dorner's statements , suggesting that they might become a rallying cry for the disaffected "" Just look at the Facebook postings around this issue and some of the crazies that come out of the woodwork who are rallying to this guy's cause , "" he said Mr . Smart said there had been significant improvements in the Police Department's standing with minorities over the past decade , even if some problems remained He expressed concern that the nuances of that situation could be lost "" While there's been a lot of improvement , there's still a need to make better relations , "" he said "" Whether or not all these things happened to him or not , this is causing some people — you can see this on Facebook , on the articles online — to say , ' I told you so .

0,"Colleges Spending Millions to Deal With Sexual Misconduct Complaints In a brightly lit classroom here at Harvard , Mia Karvonides was trying to explain to a group of bemused student leaders the difference between a romantic encounter and "" unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature , "" as the university's relatively new code of sexual misconduct defines it She tried to leaven the legalistic atmosphere at the town-hall-style meeting with realistic-sounding examples , defying gender stereotypes Jose and Lisa , chemistry students , are working late at night in the lab , she began , when Lisa comes up from behind and kisses Jose on the neck Such a surprise move , she suggested , could be the beginning of a sexual misconduct complaint "" I want to acknowledge that this isn't so simple , "" Ms . Karvonides said "" I don't have any magic words for you It takes a little bit of a closer look to grasp the concepts . Ms . Karvonides is Harvard's first Title IX officer , leading a new bureaucracy that oversees how the institution responds to complaints of sexual violence under Title IX , the federal law that governs gender equity in education She is one of a rapidly growing number of Title IX employees on campuses nationwide , as colleges spend millions to hire lawyers , investigators , case workers , survivor advocates , peer counselors , workshop leaders and other officials to deal with increasing numbers of these complaints Recently , the dean of the law school at the University of California , Berkeley , resigned when it became public that he had been disciplined for sexually harassing his executive assistant , yet had been allowed to remain on the job The dean apologized , though he later disputed the circumstances of the case And the captain of Yale's basketball team was expelled in February after a confidential school proceeding found that he had nonconsensual sex with a female student , according to his lawyer But the lawyer said the former player maintained that the woman had consented The expansion of Title IX bureaucracies — often at great expense — is driven in part by pressure from the federal government , which recently put out a series of policy directives on sexual misconduct on campus More than 200 colleges and universities are under federal investigation for the way they have handled complaints of sexual misconduct , up from 55 two years ago But the growth of these bureaucracies also reflects the difficulties that students , parents , administrators and faculty members face as they negotiate changing ideas and standards of sexual behavior And in a report last week , a national association of professors said that the Title IX bureaucracy had started to infringe on academic freedom , by beginning investigations into faculty members ' lectures and essays Because of these complexities , dealing with these kinds of cases has been wrenching for students , faculty members and administrators Many women's groups have set a much lower bar for what constitutes sexual misconduct than previous generations , leading to more internal review of campus behavior "" I think this is becoming more of an issue because it's actually being recognized as an issue , rather than hidden behind the veils that existed for previous generations , "" said Melanie Boyd , an assistant dean for student affairs at Yale College who oversees sexual violence prevention programs Title IX , enacted in 1972 , bars discrimination on the basis of sex in educational programs that receive federal funds It is more familiar as the law used to promote gender equity in sports and faculty hiring But a 2011 federal policy statement clarified that it also applies to how universities deal with complaints of sexual assault At a minimum , federal rules require colleges to designate one Title IX coordinator , at least part time Many colleges have gone far beyond that , at a cost ranging from thousands to millions of dollars College officials said it was difficult to put a price tag on the efforts because they often spanned more than one department and involved volunteers and doubling up on jobs "" There's so much more litigation on all sides of the issue , "" said Brett Sokolow , the executive director of the Association of Title IX Administrators , an industry group of 5,000 members that did not exist in 2011 , and has doubled in size for each of the past two years "" This has very much created a cottage industry . Title IX coordinators , who carry out policy and oversee how institutions respond to complaints , can earn $ 50,000 to $ 150,000 a year Mr . Sokolow estimated that the cost of lawyers , counselors , information campaigns and training to fight sexual misconduct ranges from $ 25,000 a year at a small college to $ 500,000 and up at larger or wealthier institutions At the University of California , Berkeley , officials said , Title IX spending has risen by at least $ 2 million since 2013 , though they declined to give the total "" Certainly , colleges are spending more related to Title IX than ever in history , both preventatively and responsively , "" Mr . Sokolow said He estimated that dealing with an inquiry could cost "" six figures , "" and that responding to a lawsuit "" can run into the high six or even seven figures , not counting a settlement or verdict . A check of employment ads online found recent calls for Title IX officials at the University of Chicago , Elon University , Barnard College , George Mason University , University of the Pacific , Lynn University and Columbia University Columbia guarantees outside counsel to advise students on either side of the sexual misconduct hearing process , with the university picking up the bill It has doubled the number of advocates , educators and counselors to 11 from five just three years ago Instead of two investigators and case workers , it now has seven At Yale , nearly 30 faculty and staff members work part time or full time in support of Title IX efforts , and twice as many faculty and staff members and students volunteer as advisers and committee members In addition , Yale has trained 48 students who are paid to listen to students and intercede when they seem to be in distress Occidental College in Los Angeles hired a law firm , Pepper Hamilton , to conduct what was essentially a Title IX compliance audit Harvard has 50 full-time and part-time Title IX coordinators across 13 schools Ms . Karvonides , a civil rights and education lawyer , was hired in March 2013 Under her leadership , the university adopted the new sexual misconduct policy and created a bureau of trained investigators Harvard dormitories have tutors for students to talk to about matters of sexual conduct This month , a task force recommended that the university put more resources into sexual assault prevention , including hiring one or more people to coordinate the disparate efforts Still , despite the best efforts of Ms . Karvonides and others , students are yearning for a clear code of conduct Some campuses have adopted "" affirmative consent "" rules , in effect a written or unwritten contract , requiring a yes before the first kiss and at every step along the way Harvard has opted instead for what Ms . Karvonides called a more nuanced standard of "" unwelcome conduct . This has led to criticism by some that the policy is not strong enough , and by others that it could punish behavior as mild as flirting "" This is ubiquitously on the mind of everyone at Harvard , "" said Daniel Banks , the undergraduate council vice president , who helped organize the recent town-hall-style meeting on the subject Many students have concluded that the best solution is not so much compliance as avoidance "" You either don't date at all , "" said Daniel Levine , another student leader , "" or you're like a married couple .

S . does not allow events such as the Brussels attacks to derail our current overall strategy against that enemy To understand more fully why , we should take a close , honest look at what happened in the capital of the European Union For decades , Brussels has been the deceptively picturesque European Wild West of global terrorism , the place where anyone could buy almost any kind of long arm or sidearm , where the materials for constructing crude chemical bombs such as those used in both Paris and Belgium could be easily purchased and mixed with relative impunity PRESIDENT OBAMA SAYS DON'T LET TERRORISTS ' WEAKEN OUR FAITH ' All this remained true so long as the Belgian government obeyed the one Eternal Rule of Appeasement : If you confine your attacks to nations other than our own , we will leave you alone to do your dirty work It never works The clock always runs out on appeasers It ran out on the U . S . when President Bill Clinton ignored the advice of his most informed advisers , such as Richard Clarke , and made only meager attempts to decapitate Al Qaeda It ran out on Britain when popular sentiment in that country shifted away from the aggressive pursuit of Islamists and their supporters Yet now , these supposedly surprise attacks are being used by everyone from ordinarily liberal voices to fire-eating conservatives to prove that President Obama's approach to fighting the Islamic State is supposedly mistaken Ordinarily , these claims could be dismissed as the panicky rants of opportunistic politicians , terrified periodical columnists and book-flogging terrorism specialists Underlying all such mistaken talk has been one consistent claim : Obama's strategy of using Special Forces to advise local fighters , mark targets for American bombers and drones , and kill or capture enemy leaders is not enough We must do more , they say The West as a whole must do more Someone must do something This isn't all wrong It is true , for instance , that the other members of the West have done far too little to fight the Islamic State It is also true that Obama arrived at his current strategy only after a long string of foolish declarations of "" red lines "" and other failed policies But none of this means that the President and his team have not , at last , hit — even if accidentally — on the correct strategy : of steady , consistent but precise air and Special Forces attacks to slowly but surely strangle ISIS It is understandable that we would like to simply "" wipe ISIS out , "" as more than one Republican candidate has put it Kill their families , torture combatants when captured , says Donald Trump "" Intensify attacks , "" adds Hillary Clinton , and create a "" broader target set , "" as if such were just a matter of flipping a strategic switch But Americans need to understand one threshold psychological fact : In the global war on terrorism , which is what we are still fighting and will be fighting for many years to come , there is never going to be a "" Hiroshima event . Ever since the end of the Second World War in the Pacific , which at last wrote an end to the many years of that global conflict , Americans have clung desperately to one notion : that if anyone terrified us too greatly , or threatened us too greatly , or killed too many of our civilians , they could ultimately be dispatched , "" nuked back to the Stone Age . Yet how do you achieve such a result in the case of Islamists who are hiding amid the roughly 1.6 billion Muslims worldwide And what of the innocent civilian lives that Donald Trump and his ilk claim to care so little about Is any American leader really prepared to slaughter them The answer , of course , is no There will be no sudden act or decision on our part that will produce a quick victory , especially any decision to lower ourselves ( again ) by torturing prisoners or committing other war crimes If anything ought to have demonstrated the truth of this point , it was the killing of Osama Bin Laden When word of the Al Qaeda leader's death at the hands of American Special Forces operatives hit the airwaves in this country , people filled the streets in demonstrations of relief and premature triumph Yet Bin Laden's death has meant very little to the overall cause of radical Islamist terrorism Indeed , in the case of ISIS , it has probably made matters worse , by removing the one man within the Islamist community who could and indeed was trying to prevent the most savage Islamist elements from butchering civilians and other Muslims ""Obama's current policy is , indeed , a slow strangulation But it is the only militarily feasible way to proceed If we attempt something more dramatic , not only will we again impoverish our national treasure , not only we will we play into ISIS ' hands by bringing it new recruits , not only will we further betray American values , we will also not succeed Sadly , since 9 , this has never been a satisfactory answer for a panicky America "

Aziz , 74 , and other top figures in what had been Mr . Hussein's government For years , Mr . Aziz , a former foreign minister and deputy prime minister , served as the bespectacled face of that government , a cigar-smoking emissary who sought to justify , in fluent English , Iraq's use of chemical weapons , invasion of oil-rich Kuwait , and killings of Shiites and Kurds Because Mr . Hussein rarely left Iraq out of fears for his safety , Mr . Aziz often represented Iraq at the United Nations and other global settings , serving as a public defender of Mr . Hussein before the American-led invasion of 2003 Mr . Aziz surrendered to American forces shortly after the invasion , aware that , for Americans , he was among Iraq's most hunted officials and one of the best-known emblems of the Hussein era He was handed over to Iraqi jailers this year as part of the United States transfer of security powers to Iraq as it withdrew its last combat troops Mr . Aziz's death sentence followed convictions on charges of persecution against members of the religious Shiite Dawa Party , whose members include Iraq's current prime minister , Nuri Kamal al-Maliki It was unclear when Mr . Aziz would be executed , if ever One of Mr . Aziz's lawyers , Badea Araf Azzit , said he was considering whether to appeal He dismissed the sentence as a ploy aimed at distracting attention from Iraq's political stalemate and the recent publication of a trove of American war records that described widespread prisoner abuse by Iraqi guards and security forces "" It is a political judgment , "" Mr . Azzit said Mr . Aziz's lawyers have long claimed that he was responsible only for Iraq's diplomatic and political relations , and that he had no ties to the executions and purges carried out by Mr . Hussein's government Mr . Hussein was hanged in 2006 , less than two months after his death sentence was handed down In a telephone interview , Mr . Aziz's son Ziad , 44 , said he believed that his father was blindsided by the news When they spoke by telephone three days earlier , Tariq Aziz asked his son , who lives in Jordan , to send him clothes , food and medicine , and he did not mention that sentencing was imminent "" We don't know the next step , "" Ziad Aziz said "" We have no chance of protecting him . Ziad Aziz said his father remained in poor health In January , the American military said in a statement that he had a blood clot in the brain He was taken to an American military hospital north of Baghdad for treatment In March 2009 , Mr . Aziz was sentenced to 15 years in prison for crimes against humanity , but he was acquitted earlier that month on charges of ordering a 1999 crackdown against Shiite protesters after a revered Shiite cleric was assassinated He is also serving a seven-year prison sentence for a case involving the forced displacement of Kurds in northern Iraq Death sentences were also handed down on Tuesday against other former officials in Mr . Hussein's government including Abed Hammoud , a former secretary to Mr . Hussein , and former Interior Minister Sadoun Shakir In other developments in Iraq on Tuesday : ¶ Gunmen in the northern city of Kirkuk , armed with hand grenades and rocket-propelled grenades , staged an audacious evening robbery on the city's largest gold market , killing 10 people — at least 6 of them police officers — and wounding 15 others It was part of a string of deadly and coordinated robberies against Iraqi merchants ¶ Further north , the political gamesmanship over who will control Iraq's new government continued Former Prime Minister Ayad Allawi traveled to Erbil to meet with the Kurdish region's president , Massoud Barzani , whose support is likely to be critical in breaking the deadlock The Kurds emerged as political kingmakers after March elections failed to produce a clear winner , precipitating a deadlock between Mr . Maliki's Shiite coalition and the group led by Mr . Allawi , which narrowly won the most seats in Parliament Mr . Maliki , who has remained acting prime minister during the deadlock , now appears likely to keep his job after winning the support of a bloc led by Moktada al-Sadr , a Shiite cleric known for his anti-American bent and intimate ties to Iran "

Another senior Bush official involved in those tense events a year ago said that protecting the new president was not enough Even a failed attack would send a debilitating message to the world "" If something happens on the podium and there's chaos , "" this official told me , "" that's the first time you see the new president , and you really don't want that . The threat seemed to weigh on Obama He canceled a practice session to go over his inaugural address with aides at Blair House David Axelrod , his senior adviser , later interpreted that as a sign that Obama was thinking about the suspected plot "" He seemed more subdued than he had been , "" Axelrod told me not long ago Obama had not yet taken office , and he was already being confronted with the threat that consumed his predecessor's presidency No matter how much he thought about terrorism as a senator or as a presidential candidate , it was another thing to face it as the person responsible for the nation's security — and quite another thing again to know the threat was aimed directly at himself , his wife and their two daughters "" It's not as if you don't know what you're getting into , "" Axelrod said "" But when the reality comes and the baton is being passed and you're now dealing with real terrorism threats , it's a very sobering moment . There was little Obama could do but ask questions and rely on the people who had been fighting this fight for years His advisers worked side by side with the outgoing administration The two teams gathered in the Situation Room of the White House shortly before the inauguration to sift through what was known and to hash out what should be done about it The final iteration of Bush's team sat across the table from the brain trust of Obama's administration — Condoleezza Rice , Stephen Hadley and their colleagues on one side , Hillary Rodham Clinton , James Jones and their colleagues on the other Clinton immediately put her finger on a problem According to participants , she asked , What should Obama do if he is in the middle of his inaugural address and a bomb goes off somewhere on the mall "" Is the Secret Service going to whisk him off the podium so the American people see their incoming president disappear in the middle of the inaugural address ? she asked "" I don't think so . Among those in the room was Robert Gates , who served two years as Bush's defense secretary and would remain in that post under Obama Gates would eventually stay away from the inauguration in a secret location With no other member of Obama's cabinet confirmed by the Senate , Gates — an incumbent cabinet officer who also had the imprimatur of the newly elected commander in chief — was the most logical person in the line of succession to take over the presidency should the worst happen At the heart of the deliberations about what to do was John Brennan , a former C . I . A officer A Middle East specialist known for setting up the National Counterterrorism Center for Bush , Brennan was coming back after three years out of government as the top counterterrorism official in the White House He had wanted to be C . I . A director but found his potential appointment sunk by liberal protests over his ties to the old order , so instead he was made assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism , a position that did not require Senate confirmation As he helped manage the inaugural threat , culling reports and coordinating between two administrations , Brennan was already becoming the most important voice in the ear of the new president as he moved to reshape the nation's struggle with terrorists If it is now Obama's war , Brennan is his general And the first battle set the tone "" It was a poignant reminder of the seriousness of the issue the president would be facing , on the eve of the inauguration , "" Brennan told me in November Brennan suspected that the threat was a classic "" poison pen , "" when one group of radicals rats out another group to get Americans to take out its rivals , and he was right In this case , officials familiar with the situation said , some Somali extremists knew that a rival group was traveling to the United States and planted false information about its intentions that got back to the Americans In the end , what for 72 hours looked like a credible threat turned out to be a false alarm For a fledgling president , the incident would be a lesson in the fluid , murky nature of terrorism The challenge of leading the struggle against violent extremists is more than just hunting down bad guys ; it's distinguishing between what's real and what's not , tracking down where threats begin , figuring out the right response and finding a balance between acknowledging danger and projecting confidence The Obama administration spent its first year in office trying to find its balance BARACK OBAMA WAS inaugurated as the first president to take office in the Age of Terrorism He inherited two struggles — one with Al Qaeda and its ideological allies , and another that divides his own country over issues like torture , prosecutions , security and what it means to be an American The first has proved to be complicated and daunting The second makes the first look easy The attempted bombing of a Northwest Airlines passenger jet on Christmas Day heightened a debate that has percolated over the past 12 months ""Obama's approach has been either a dangerous reversal of the Bush years or a consolidation of the Bush years , depending on who is talking In fact , the new president , during his first year , has adopted the bulk of the counterterrorism strategy he found on his desk when he arrived in the Oval Office , a strategy already moderated from the earliest days after Sept . 11 , 2001 He did , however , shave back some of the harsher edges of the remaining Bush policies and in the process of his recalibrations drew simultaneous fire from former Vice President Dick Cheney and the American Civil Liberties Union Obama , then , found himself in a place where he seems most comfortable , splitting the difference on a tough issue and presenting it as the course of reasoned judgment rather than of dogmatic ideology Where Bush saw black and white , Obama sees gray Where Bush favored swagger , Obama is searching for a more supple blend of force and intellect Where Bush saw Islamic extremism as an existential threat equivalent to Nazism or Communism , Obama contends that that view warps the situation out of proportion and plays into terrorists ' hands by elevating their stature and allowing them — even without attacking again — to alter the nature of American society With joblessness still plaguing the economy and health care dominating his agenda , Obama has not wanted his presidency to be defined by the war on terror , as Bush's was He has given relatively few public speeches on the topic and declined to discuss it for this article Rather than seeing terrorism as the challenge of our time , Obama rejects the phrase "" war on terror "" altogether , hoping to recast the struggle as only one of a number of vital challenges confronting America The nation is at war with Al Qaeda , Obama says , but not with terrorism , which , as he understands it , is a tactic , not an enemy "" There was a tendency on the part of some to view the world through that prism — you know , are you with us or against us , black and white , this global war on terror , "" Brennan told me a couple of months ago in his windowless , low-ceilinged , soundproof office in the West Wing , where mobile phones are banned "" It was almost all-consuming It was the driving force for our foreign policies , that we were now engaged in this march on the global war on terror . That attitude , Brennan went on to say , proved counterproductive "" This president recognizes that there's still a very serious terrorist threat that we face from organizations like Al Qaeda , "" he said "" But at the same time , what we have to do is make sure that we're not pouring fuel on the flames by the things that we do . And so perhaps the biggest change Obama has made is what one former adviser calls the "" mood music "" — choice of language , outreach to Muslims , rhetorical fidelity to the rule of law and a shift in tone from the all-or-nothing days of the Bush administration He is committed to taking aggressive actions to disrupt terrorist cells , aides said , but he also considers his speech in Cairo to the Islamic world in June central to his efforts to combat terrorism "" If you asked him what are the most important things he's done to fight terrorism in his first year , he would put Cairo in the top three , "" Rahm Emanuel , his chief of staff , told me The policies themselves , though , have not changed nearly as much as the political battles over closing the prison at Guant ánamo Bay and trying Khalid Shaikh Mohammed in New York would suggest "" The administration came in determined to undo a lot of the policies of the prior administration , "" Senator Susan Collins of Maine , the top Republican on the homeland-security committee , told me , "" but in fact is finding that many of those policies were better-thought-out than they realized — or that doing away with them is a far more complex task . If terrorism has not been the driving force of the Obama presidency , neither has it been the catalytic issue to the American people that it was more than eight years ago , when the twin towers collapsed in a heap of steel , concrete and bodies Yet that mood can change in a hurry , as the Christmas Day plot showed Obama understands that , if only by the law of averages , there is a decent chance of a successful major attack on the United States during his presidency And if that attack happens , any change in policy , no matter how incidental to the facts of the case , will be fodder for critics to blame him for the attack When the aviation screening and intelligence systems that Bush built failed to stop Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , a 23 - year-old Nigerian with ties to Al Qaeda's branch in Yemen , from getting on a plane bound for Detroit with explosives in his underwear last month , a number of Obama's political opponents blamed the sitting president If Bush's system was broken , they asked , why didn't Obama fix it Continue reading the main story Related Coverage The Label Factor : Is Obama a Wimp or a Warrior JAN . 9 , 2010 But the underlying complaint seemed less about any particular policy than about Obama himself — how he reacted , how he spoke , how he led Although he held conference calls every day with Brennan , who was back in Washington , it took Obama three days to emerge from his Hawaiian vacation to address the matter in public , and when he did , he was typically cool and cerebral , with none of Bush's bring-it-on , dead-or-alive rhetoric Never mind that Bush took six days to publicly address the 2001 case of Richard Reid , the shoe bomber , or that Reid was charged in civilian court , not as an enemy combatant ; critics like Cheney argued again that Obama did not believe America was at war Bush felt it in his gut Obama thinks about it in his head If he rushed out in public to talk the minute something happened , wouldn't that play into the hands of those trying to instill fear in the American people ""Shouldn't he prudently wait for more information Yet with the country afraid , is it possible to overthink it "" You've got almost two extremes , "" Henry Crumpton , who led the C . I . A ""' s operation in Afghanistan after Sept . 11 and who later served as counterterrorism chief at the State Department under Bush , told me several weeks before the Christmas Day attempt "" You've got Bush 43 , who aspired to have a warrior's ethos He was driven , I think , by that , and in some ways it hurt us with the lack of rigor and examination of some of the consequences of our actions , Iraq being the most horrible extreme Obama comes at it from the other extreme He comes at it like a lawyer would , someone who may not accept and may even reject this idea of a warrior's ethos And it is a war ""You've got guys out there who want to kill us . OBAMA WAS A STATE senator in Illinois when the planes smashed into the World Trade Center , the Pentagon and an empty field in Pennsylvania He was driving to a legislative hearing in Chicago when he heard early reports on the radio "" By the time I arrived at my meeting , "" he wrote in his book "" The Audacity of Hope , "" "" the second plane had already hit , and we were told to evacuate the State of Illinois Building Up and down the streets , people gathered , staring at the sky and at the Sears Tower Later , in my law office , a group of us sat motionless as the nightmare images unfolded across the TV screen . That day instilled in Bush a sense of unwavering purpose , but Obama's support for the pursuit of Al Qaeda in Afghanistan gave way to doubts about the circumvention of legal structures at home and eventually outright opposition to the war in Iraq begun in the name of Sept . 11 As a Harvard Law School graduate who taught constitutional law and spent part of his childhood in Indonesia , the world's most populous Muslim nation , Obama saw the emerging global struggle through a different lens In the spring of 2007 , when he was a presidential candidate , Obama met Richard Clarke , the former White House counterterrorism chief who had become one of Bush's sharpest critics on terrorism and national security The two got together in a run-down apartment a few blocks from the Capitol that Obama used for inconspicuous meetings "" When I first sat down with him and started going through my standard pitch , he was finishing the sentences , "" Clarke told me "" I'd like to think it was because he read my book , but it's a heck of a lot more involved than my book ""He'd talked with a lot of people ""He'd read a lot about it And he had a real understanding . Clarke became his campaign counterterrorism adviser , and Obama decided to give a speech outlining his view of how to combat extremists and how not to His advisers told him he had a choice : he could try to out-Cheney Cheney and demonstrate that when it comes to national security , Democrats also have hairy chests , as one put it , or he could develop a new paradigm Obama , typically , found the idea of a new paradigm more appealing , although he threw in a vow to strike terrorists in Pakistan even , if necessary , without permission of its government "" It is time to turn the page , "" he declared in the speech he gave in Washington in August 2007 He said that "" America is at war with terrorists who killed on our soil ; we are not at war with Islam . He criticized claims of "" unchecked presidential power "" and vowed "" to close Guant ánamo , reject the Military Commissions Act and adhere to the Geneva Conventions . He said "" that means no more illegal wiretapping of American citizens , no more national-security letters to spy on citizens who are not suspected of a crime "" and "" no more ignoring the law when it is inconvenient . By the time he won the presidency more than a year later , he was receiving classified briefings on terrorist networks around the world The government's top intelligence officials beat a path to Chicago to fill him in They confronted him with the dark side , as Cheney once put it "" The risks we are talking about are the things you don't want to talk about around the Thanksgiving table , "" Janet Napolitano , the secretary of homeland security , told me Yet even some of the Bush appointees were ready for change , appealing to Obama to revamp the struggle "" Mr . President-elect , we're doing things very well , but we're losing the messaging war , "" Michael Leiter , the director of the National Counterterrorism Center , told him a week after the election , according to an official informed about the session A significant share of the global population thought America was at war against the rest of the world , Leiter maintained "" You have an opportunity to change that message , to change how the struggle is perceived , "" he said Obama was receptive to that mandate "" We're going to do that , "" he replied When Obama sat down to talk with the outgoing president , Bush pressed him to be vigilant every day "" That's mostly what they talked about , "" a senior Bush adviser told me "" I think President Bush came away thinking that President Obama understood at an intellectual level , but you don't really understand at a gut level until you're in that seat . Martha Joynt Kumar , a professor at Towson University who wrote about the inaugural threat in a paper published last month in the journal Presidential Studies Quarterly , said the teamwork between old and new administrations marked one of the smoothest presidential transitions in modern times Yet for all the cooperation , Obama chose to make one of his first acts a strike against the Bush legacy , signing executive orders drafted by his new White House counsel , Greg Craig , that banned interrogation techniques like waterboarding as torture and ordered the prison at Guant ánamo closed within a year The move generated debate about timing and tactics John Podesta , who ran Obama's transition , agreed with the policy but argued against making Guant ánamo the first priority right after inauguration , according to colleagues Craig and others countered that it was important to send a signal of change from the start Obama also wanted to uproot the resentments and hatred that fuel extremism "" The language we use matters , "" he told the Al Arabiya television network a week after taking office So Obama informally banished the rhetoric of the last administration "" War on terror "" was out ; so were "" Islamofascism "" and "" evildoers . The new language did not always go over well While testifying to Congress a year ago , Napolitano used the phrase "" man-caused disasters , "" and though she said "" terrorism "" elsewhere in her remarks , she drew wide scorn ( "" I was totally misinterpreted in a sense of what I was trying to communicate , "" she later told me "" It was just a mistake In the editing process , that phrase , usually it's ' terrorism or other man-caused disasters . ' "" ) BRENNAN , WHO HAS emerged in recent days as the administration's public face for counterterrorism policy , is solidly built , with a weathered face and close-cropped , retreating hair His eyes seem to take your measure when you walk into the room , studying intently as if searching for your ulterior motives He is friendly and unfailingly polite but does not laugh easily He is a serious man in a serious business , a career man , a survivor , someone who has navigated the treacherous politics of the intelligence world and vaulted to great heights only to be disappointed And now he is helping Obama redirect the war against Al Qaeda A native of North Bergen , N . J . , Brennan , who is 54 , attended Catholic schools , all the way through Fordham University After his freshman year , he went to Indonesia in the summer of 1974 to visit a cousin who was working there , and in the same country that helped shape Obama's worldview , Brennan developed a case of youthful wanderlust He studied Arabic and played basketball with Egyptians at the American University in Cairo before earning a master's degree in Middle East studies at the University of Texas at Austin While reading The New York Times on a bus one day , he saw a C . I . A recruitment ad and decided to apply When I asked why , he gave an answer that sounded as if it came from an espionage novel "" Nathan Hale was hanged on the day of my birth , "" he said of the nation's first spy At the C . I . A . , Brennan rose through the ranks , becoming station chief in Saudi Arabia during the late 1990s , a time of rising Islamic terrorism Just months before he arrived in Riyadh , terrorists blew up the Khobar Towers apartment complex , killing 19 American service members During his tour , they also attacked American embassies in Tanzania and Kenya A favorite of George J . Tenet , the C . I . A director first appointed by President Bill Clinton and later retained by Bush , Brennan would become Tenet's chief of staff and later the agency's deputy executive director After Sept . 11 , Brennan helped set up the Terrorist Threat Integration Center and served as its first and only director But his steady rise reached a peak When the center was refashioned as the National Counterterrorism Center , bringing together experts across the government to coordinate the war on terror , he served as interim director but was never given the permanent job Brennan , unhappy , left government in 2005 and went on to write a proposed op-ed essay that he titled , "" Mr . President , You're Wrong on Iraq . In keeping with C . I . A rules , he submitted it for classification review by the agency before distributing it to any newspapers for publication A copy found its way to the White House , where it angered top officials Brennan ultimately thought better of the article and withdrew it from C . I . A review , but it was too late to salvage his standing at the White House "" He was dead to them , "" says a friend and fellow senior official , who did not want to be named discussing internal matters An attempt to later make him deputy director of national intelligence was killed by the White House Obama presented another chance "" This is redemption , "" the friend says Anthony Lake , a former national security adviser who knew Brennan from his days as a C . I . A briefer in the Clinton White House , was working for Obama's nascent presidential campaign and brought in the former intelligence officer to advise the candidate in 2007 Obama grew to like Brennan's precise , matter-of-fact style so much that after the election he considered making him the C . I . A director But the idea of appointing Tenet's right-hand man , a C . I . A careerist who was at the center of the Bush war on terror , rankled Obama supporters on the left Stephen Soldz , a psychologist at the Boston Graduate School of Psychoanalysis and a leader of the Coalition for an Ethical Psychology , circulated a letter of opposition to Brennan signed by 200 other psychologists The letter cited an interview Brennan gave in 2006 to PBS's "" Frontline , "" in which he said Tenet's concern in devising the Bush-era interrogation program was making sure it was on sound legal footing "" We know , of course , that ' the appropriate Department of Justice review ' means that torture was authorized and conducted by our government , "" Soldz's letter said But the letter did not quote the rest of what Brennan said in that interview as he grappled with the morality of the government's actions "" There was a real debate within the agency , including today , about what are the minimum standards that you want to stoop to and beyond where you're not going to go , because we don't want to stoop to using the same types of standards that terrorists use , "" he told PBS "" We are in this business , whether it be intelligence or the government , to protect freedom , democracy and liberty , not to violate that . Still , human rights advocates have a point about continuity For all his talk of change , Obama has kept a lot of veterans of the Bush administration in place Besides Brennan , there is Gates still atop the Pentagon , as well as Mike Mullen , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff appointed by Bush , and Michael Vickers , still the assistant defense secretary for special operations While Obama tapped Leon Panetta to take over the C . I . A . , he kept the deputy director , Stephen Kappes , along with Leiter , the head of the National Counterterrorism Center Obama fired the top general in Afghanistan , but the head of the regional military command overseeing both Afghanistan and Iraq remains Bush's favorite officer , Gen . David Petraeus , and the White House coordinator for Afghanistan and Pakistan is Bush's Iraq war czar , Lt . Gen . Douglas Lute To manage the effort to close Guant ánamo , Obama named one of Bush's assistant secretaries of state , Daniel Fried The Treasury under secretary chasing terrorist financing is still Stuart Levey , and the National Security Council's senior director for combating terrorism is still Nick Rasmussen Most of those people , of course , were in the moderate camp inside the Bush administration , not the Cheney cadre , or like Brennan they present themselves as simply career professionals who followed orders or who even quietly dissented from the most extreme policies of the last eight years "" I was somebody who did oppose waterboarding , "" Brennan told me "" I opposed different aspects of the enhanced interrogation program But there were some aspects of it that I concurred with . For instance , he offered , "" if you grab somebody by the lapels , and you say , Oh , my goodness , you've violated their rights as a person , well , I'm not going to go that far . Time and circumstances have changed as well "" Four years ago , I would have said — and I did say — the agency's detention program needed to continue , "" Brennan said , referring to the secret "" black site "" overseas prisons run by the C . I . A "" There have been a lot of developments and changes , so the things I might have advocated three or four years ago , because of the changed conditions , because of a new administration , whatever , I wouldn't necessarily advocate them now at all ""I've changed my views . Soldz told me he has been pleased that Brennan has said the right things since taking the White House job But Obama's refusal to completely repudiate the Bush-era policies bothers Soldz "" I wake up some mornings disgusted by Obama , "" he said "" And then I think about it some more and understand the pressure he's under So I'm having these battles inside myself . SEVERAL WEEKS AFTER Obama took office , I sat down with the president , along with three colleagues from The Times , in his conference room on Air Force One during a flight back from an event in Ohio Now that he was in office , we asked what , if anything , he had come to believe that Bush had gotten right in the balance between security and civil liberties The candidate who denounced the "" color-coded politics of fear "" and rejected policies that "" compromised our most precious values "" was now a commander in chief wrestling with how to protect those values and the country at the same time He told us that many of the worst practices he had objected to had already been corrected by the end of Bush's presidency "" I would distinguish between some of the steps that were taken immediately after 9 and where we were by the time I took office , "" he told us "" I think the C . I . A . , for example , and some of the controversial programs that have been a focus of a lot of attention , took steps to correct certain policies and procedures after those first couple of years . The battle with terrorists evolved significantly over the course of the Bush presidency , and when Obama took office , the course he set was mostly to accelerate the evolution that was already under way Under pressure from Supreme Court rulings , Congressional legislation and disclosures in the news media , Bush in his second term trimmed back some of his most expansive programs and claims to executive power Two years before leaving office , he told advisers he wanted to use his remaining time to institutionalize what was left so that his successor , even a Democrat , would not feel compelled to reverse direction By the time Obama was inaugurated , waterboarding had been halted for years , Bush had ordered that the secret C . I . A black site prisons be emptied , and the warrantless surveillance program and the military commission system had been restructured and approved by Congress Bush had even declared that he wanted to close the Guant ánamo prison , and although he never managed to do so , his team released or transferred about 500 detainees as a first step Obama built on those actions "" We've benefited from their experiences , both the good and the bad , "" Emanuel told me While setting a one-year deadline to close Guant ánamo and formally banning the interrogation methods that had already fallen out of favor , Obama left the surveillance program intact , embraced the Patriot Act , retained the authority to use renditions and embraced some of Bush's claims to state secrets He preserved the military commissions and national security letters he criticized during the campaign , albeit with more due-process safeguards He plans to hold dozens of suspected terrorists without charges indefinitely And he expanded Bush's campaign of unmanned drone strikes against Al Qaeda in the tribal areas of Pakistan Troop levels in Afghanistan are set to triple on his watch A half-dozen former senior Bush officials involved in counterterrorism told me before the Christmas Day incident that for the most part , they were comfortable with Obama's policies , although they were reluctant to say so on the record Some worried they would draw the ire of Cheney's circle if they did , while others calculated that calling attention to the similarities to Bush would only make it harder for Obama to stay the course And they generally resented Obama's anti-Bush rhetoric and were unwilling to give him political cover by defending him Michael Hayden , the last C . I . A director under Bush , was willing to say publicly what others would not "" There is a continuum from the Bush administration , particularly as it changed in the second administration as circumstances changed , and the Obama administration , "" Hayden told me James Jay Carafano , a homeland-security expert at the Heritage Foundation , was blunter "" I don't think it's even fair to call it Bush Lite , "" he said "" It's Bush ""It's really , really hard to find a difference that's meaningful and not atmospheric You see a lot of straining on things trying to make things look repackaged , but they're really not that different . Not every Bush veteran agrees , of course Marc Thiessen , a former White House speechwriter , has a new book called "" Courting Disaster : How the C . I . A Kept America Safe and How Barack Obama Is Inviting the Next Attack . Tom Ridge , the former homeland security secretary , told me before the Christmas Day plot that under Obama , Washington had "" lost a certain sense of urgency and commitment to combating terrorism . Most disturbing to the Bush camp , even to those who generally see continuity in Obama's policies , have been Attorney General Eric Holder's decisions to release legal memos that described interrogation techniques used by the C . I . A . , to reinvestigate allegations of interrogation abuse by C . I . A officers and to take Khalid Shaikh Mohammed , the self-declared mastermind of the Sept . 11 attacks , to New York to face trial in civilian court Hayden recalled warning Jim Jones , Obama's national security adviser , last spring not to alienate the C . I . A by dredging up the past "" You're about to spend the next 46 months without a clandestine service , "" Hayden recalled saying "" If these guys don't think you have their back , they're not going to be very adventurous . There is ample historical precedent for this cycle During times of national crisis , Washington often claims more authority , sometimes to the point of excess , then slowly cedes it back , from the Sedition Act signed by John Adams to Abraham Lincoln's suspension of habeas corpus during the Civil War to Franklin D . Roosevelt's internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II — all cases in which the system eventually corrected itself in one fashion or another "" Historically the more we move away from a crisis , the better we're able to see the costs and benefits of what we're doing , and we go from being extremely risk-averse to finding a better balance , "" says Geoffrey Stone , a professor and former dean at the University of Chicago law school Bush has pointed to another historical pattern In private discussions with associates during the 2008 presidential campaign , he predicted that if a Democrat won , he or she would be like Dwight Eisenhower to his Harry Truman Just as Eisenhower on the campaign trail criticized Truman's policies in the early years of the cold war only to essentially adopt them after taking office , Bush anticipated that his successor would preserve most of what he had put in place Of course , this conveniently fits into Bush's hope that , like Truman , he will look better in the eyes of history A senior Obama adviser scoffed at the idea that Bush advisers see continuity , arguing that they are trying to launder their reputations by claiming validation But it is true that much of the Bush security architecture is almost certain to remain part of the national fabric for some time to come , thanks to Obama Stone , who helped bring Obama to the University of Chicago law school , says his former colleague must be wary of doing anything that would increase the risk of a terrorist attack against the United States "" He may feel in fact , "" Stone says , "" that it's a more dangerous world than he thought it was , that some of these measures may be more necessary than he thought . STONE JOINED A GROUP of human-rights and civil-liberties advocates at the White House last spring for a meeting with Obama to talk about issues of interrogation and detention Obama had struggled through a rocky few months trying to find the balance between security and liberty , arguing that America did not need to sacrifice one for the other The decision to close the Guant ánamo prison sparked a revolt in Congress , even among Democrats who worried about suspected terrorists being transferred to prisons in their states And while the administration has selected an Illinois facility to house some of the detainees , the Jan . 22 deadline to close Guant ánamo will not be met An attempt to release into the United States 17 Chinese Uighurs who were deemed no threat to Americans collapsed And although Obama authorized the release of memos detailing the use of waterboarding and other techniques now banned , he refused to release photographs showing abuse of detainees For Brennan , these issues were a chance to get right what he thought went wrong under Bush But he has found himself at odds with other advisers at times When Craig and Holder wanted to release the memos about C . I . A interrogation methods , Brennan initially agreed , reasoning that the tactics in the memos had by then been banned But he later reversed himself and sided with the C . I . A . , which argued that the memos would give terrorists too much information about how American interrogators work Brennan likewise stood with Gates and military leaders who argued unsuccessfully that releasing photographs of the abuses would inflame radicals and endanger American troops Gen . Ray Odierno , the top commander in Iraq , made a personal appeal to Obama during a visit to Washington , and the president agreed to reject Craig's recommendation to release the photos Brennan also found an ally at times in Rahm Emanuel , who was said to think that the politics of these decisions were being mishandled and that fights over detention policy used up political capital better spent on priorities like health care and the economy By the time he sat down with the human rights advocates in the Cabinet Room , Obama was preparing to make a speech at the National Archives about such issues Everyone in the room raised hard questions , voicing the disappointment of Obama's strongest supporters Perhaps the most dramatic appeal came from Anthony Romero , executive director of the A . C . L . U "" Look , you're the only politician I've ever believed in , "" Romero said , according to people in the room "" When I was a gay Puerto Rican growing up in New York , I never thought I could identify with a political leader the way I identify with you But this stuff really pains me . Obama pushed back , explaining the constraints he was under It was a balancing act , he said ; he had multiple obligations Much of the discussion concerned the military commissions he decided to keep and the dilemma of what to do with the hardest cases at Guant ánamo , those who could not be prosecuted because of tainted evidence or other reasons but were deemed too dangerous to release "" He wasn't entirely comfortable with any of the options , "" says Tom Malinowski , the Washington advocacy director of Human Rights Watch When I talked with Romero later , he would not describe his interaction with Obama , but he expressed his frustration While relieved that the new president seems more open to rethinking Bush-era policies , Romero said he suspected Obama suffers from the "" hubris "" of wanting to preserve much of the power he inherited in the belief that he will use it more wisely "" He believes he can do it better and smarter and more in keeping with constitutional principles than his predecessor did , "" Romero told me "" If he's shown himself willing to adhere to some of the Bush policies in the absence of an attack , one worries about what he'll do when an attack comes . The activists left the meeting chilled that Obama seemed poised to continue holding some terrorism suspects indefinitely without charges Just a few years earlier , he wrote in his book that "" when we detain suspects indefinitely without trial , "" then "" we weaken our ability to pressure for human rights and the rule of law in despotic regimes . Now he was talking about seeking legislation that would permanently authorize such preventive detention Romero and the A . C . L . U began preparing a campaign against any proposed legislation if he went forward , soliciting letters from international figures like Desmond Tutu , trying to recruit Jimmy Carter and contacting law-school academics But then the administration reversed course ; while it would continue to hold indefinitely without charges perhaps 50 detainees left from the Bush era , it would not enshrine the power in law and signaled that it would not use it for future cases "" We were gearing up for the battle of our lives , "" Romero said "" Fortunately , they turned back from the abyss . Liberals were also cheered by a speech Brennan gave in Washington over the summer at the Center for Strategic and International Studies Brennan said Obama "" is bringing a fundamentally new and more effective approach , "" one that would be more "" multidimensional "" without letting terrorism define American foreign policy Among other things , he emphasized the "" upstream factors , "" meaning the conditions that fuel extremism , and vowed to promote "" a political , economic and social campaign to meet the basic needs and legitimate grievances of ordinary people — security for their communities , education for children , a job and income for parents and a sense of dignity and worth . But something else was happening inside the White House Some in the West Wing , like Emanuel , worried about the collateral cost of Holder's decision that would take Khalid Shaikh Mohammed to New York Those concerns were relayed to the Justice Department , but Obama declined to intervene and let Holder make the call Still , by the end of the year , the activists ' favorite ally in the West Wing , Greg Craig , was out He resigned after months of battles over the best way to reorient the war on terror , some that he won and others that he lost "" He was the one voice for a constant application of the rule of law in the White House , "" Romero lamented "" The others either demur or mumble . ""Craig's ouster , he added , was "" unfortunate because it means the likes of Rahm Emanuel will consolidate power in the White House . AT THE HOUSE that John Brennan built , about 600 government employees keep tabs on what the extremists are up to , at least as much as they can The National Counterterrorism Center , which Brennan set up on a leafy campus overlooking the Capital Beltway in the Virginia suburbs outside Washington , is the center of the nation's efforts to hunt down Al Qaeda and its cousins Obama came to visit last fall , and Brennan accompanied him The operations center at the NCTC looks a lot like the set from "" 24 , "" the Fox television show , with dozens of analysts from an alphabet soup of agencies known by their acronyms — C . I . A . , F . B . I . , D . O . D . , N . S . A . , D . I . A . , D . H . S . , D . N . I . , T . S . A and so on — sitting together as they sift through surveillance videos , intercepted telephone calls , satellite imagery , reports from the field , news accounts and myriad other "" intelligence streams , "" as they are known A dozen large flat-screen televisions tune in everything from satellite reconnaissance to CNN Digital clocks indicate the time in hot spots around the world Multiscreen computers help collate vast quantities of information This place was supposed to help stop the attack by Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab aboard a plane over Detroit on Christmas Day Since Sept . 11 , government agencies like the NCTC have connected the dots repeatedly to head off terrorist attacks In the last few months alone , the government has arrested a number of suspected plotters in the United States But the clich é is right — the government has to be right 100 percent of the time , while the other side needs to succeed only once And Brennan produced a report this month that criticized the NCTC , his old organization , for failing to pull together intelligence that was available about Al Qaeda and Abdulmutallab before he boarded Northwest Flight 253 in Amsterdam last month The Christmas Day plot touched off a new round of questions among Obama's criticsabout whether the president is enough of a warrior for the fight against Islamic terrorism Buthe has spent much of his time in office killing suspected extremists With information processed at the NCTC and elsewhere , Obama has authorized the C . I . A to greatly expand a program inherited from Bush using unmanned Predator and Reaper drones to launch missiles at suspected Al Qaeda hideouts along the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan Critics complain that such "" targeted assassinations "" are morally suspect and strategically dangerous because of the reaction among Pakistanis when civilians are killed Obama had a searching conversation during the transition with Brennan and Denis McDonough , Catholics who oppose the death penalty , about whether to keep the program "" He was wrestling with it , "" one adviser says But in the end , there was no serious disagreement with the decision to continue the program At one of his first Situation Room meetings as president , according to a participant , Obama said pointedly , "" The C . I . A gets what it needs . The C . I . A launched more than 50 such strikes in Obama's first year in office , more than during Bush's entire presidency , according to data compiled by Peter Bergen and Katherine Tiedemann at the New America Foundation In part , that strategy owes to increasingly precise technology that has made it easier in the last couple of years to hit a desired target with fewer civilian casualties And in part , it underscores the ability to redirect resources away from Iraq now that the war has subsided there ; when the Obama administration came into office , it learned that dozens of drones were devoted to operations in Iraq and Afghanistan but just five or six in the tribal areas of Pakistan where Al Qaeda's leadership is mainly holed up , according to officials who declined to be identified discussing a classified program Obama has authorized doubling the number of drones in the Pakistani border area , as well as increasing the presence over Yemen and Somalia , officials said Over the course of Obama's first year in office , his drones have taken out a number of "" high-value targets , "" including Baitullah Mehsud , leader of the Pakistani Taliban ; Saad bin Laden , a son of Osama bin Laden ; and Tahir Yuldashev , leader of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan , a close ally of Al Qaeda At the same time , according to estimates by Bergen and Tiedemann , the civilian death rate of those killed by drone strikes has fallen to about 24 percent in 2009 from about 40 percent from 2006 to 2008 Government officials insist that the civilian casualty rate is even lower "" I don't hear anyone inside the government , including people like me who came from outside , who thinks the Predator program is anything but essential , "" a senior Obama counterterrorism official says "" There are a lot of negatives , but it is completely essential . Obama has been willing to be muscular in other ways as well When intelligence agencies concluded in September that they had found Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan , an Al Qaeda operative linked to the 2002 bombing of a Kenyan hotel , in southern Somalia , officials debated three options , including one to insert American special-operations forces in that lawless East African country , several officials told me ""Obama's advisers rejected that and presented him with a plan for an airstrike , which he approved Weather on the day of the strike prompted a change in plans , and commanders instead authorized attack helicopters to sweep into Somalia Nabhan was killed American forces landed afterward to collect bodies and evidence Most salient at the moment is Obama's focus on Yemen , the poor , unstable state south of Saudi Arabia where Osama bin Laden's family hailed from Yemen in many ways is where Obama's two wars come together It is a breeding ground for extremism , the home of the radical cleric who inspired Maj . Nidal Hasan before he opened fire at Fort Hood last fall and the origin of the Christmas Day bombing plot involving Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab At the same time , it is the place where roughly half of the remaining detainees at Guant ánamo come from , making it the central focus for efforts to close the prison Brennan visited Yemen in March and again in September to focus new energy on combating Al Qaeda there Obama has ordered more training , equipment and intelligence sharing for the Yemeni government ; about $ 70 million was set aside to bulk up Yemeni forces , doubling previous spending , and the administration has announced it will double it again next year Last month the American government provided intelligence and hardware for Yemeni airstrikes on suspected Al Qaeda hideouts Brennan has also been trying to set up a rehabilitation program for Yemen to transition former Guant ánamo detainees back into society But for all the attention on Yemen , Brennan has now acknowledged that he and the rest of the American government underestimated the capacity of Al Qaeda's branch there to attack American soil OBAMA WAS SINGING Christmas carols with his family at a rental house in Hawaii when a military aide arrived to tell him that someone tried to blow up a plane over Detroit The president got on the phone with Brennan , who told him a Nigerian man tried to ignite chemicals hidden in his underwear , only to have passengers and crew jump him Soon enough , Abdulmutallab would be tied to Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula , which operates in Yemen The Obama team's initial public response was less than sure-footed Obama referred to Abdulmutallab as an "" isolated extremist , "" and Janet Napolitano said that "" the system worked . Obama would soon learn how wrong both assessments were While on vacation he was given an 80 - page review of the Fort Hood shooting ; it looked at how information about Hasan was not well circulated within the federal government The night after his first statement , the president's advisers learned that something similar happened in the Detroit case : the government possessed National Security Agency-intercepted conversations that could have helped to stop Abdulmutallab if they had been shared widely Obama talked with Brennan and other advisers by phone the next morning He was simmering "" Let me make this very clear to you , "" he told the advisers , according to two of them "" While I understand intelligence is hard , and I'll never fault anybody for not having full intelligence , what I will fault is when we have full intelligence that's not shared . After hanging up with Brennan , aides scrambled to organize a statement to the news media Denis McDonough , the National Security Council chief of staff , typed out a draft on the president's laptop as Obama hovered over his shoulder "" What's the deal ? Obama asked "" I'm just about done , "" McDonough said "" Well , just move over . Obama sat down and finished it himself The president's statement that there was a "" systemic failure "" did not quell the political furor White House officials were caught off guard by the intensity of the criticism After reading a Cheney statement that attacked Obama for only pretending to be at war with terrorists , David Axelrod angrily wrote a long statement trashing the former vice president and gave it to Dan Pfeiffer , the White House communications director , who revised it and posted on the White House Web site The criticism got Brennan's back up too , particularly coming from some of his former colleagues in the Bush administration "" A lot of the knuckleheads I've been listening to out there on the network shows don't know what they're talking about , "" he told me after the Christmas Day attempt Some Republicans , including Cheney , were blatantly mischaracterizing the record , he fumed "" When they say the administration's not at war with Al Qaeda , that is just complete hogwash . It was the angriest I had heard him during months of conversations "" What they're doing is just playing into Al Qaeda's strategic effort , which is to get us to battle among ourselves instead of focusing on them , "" he said It is moments like these when Brennan's disaffection from the last administration becomes evident "" I much prefer talking with someone who is interested in understanding the situation and responding to it appropriately , "" Brennan told me For all of the attention on the Nigerian underwear bomber , some experts say they believe the more insidious threat will be a new generation of homegrown extremists In recent months , authorities have arrested a number of American citizens and legal residents , including Najibullah Zazi , an airport-shuttle driver who is suspected of plotting to attack New York after receiving training in Pakistan , and David Coleman Headley , a Pakistani-American accused of aiding terrorist attacks in Mumbai Just a week ago , authorities arrested two associates of Zazi's And then there is the Fort Hood shooting rampage , as well as a group of Somali-Americans from Minnesota who reportedly wanted to fight in Somalia and five American Muslims from Virginia who traveled to Pakistan supposedly to join the jihad If they are the next wave , American extremists are going to be hard to track and stop The Internet makes it possible for Al Qaeda and its allies to reach out from the dusty villages of Waziristan all the way to Illinois and Colorado "" Although no one wants to admit it , I think a watershed has been crossed in the terrorist threat in the United States , "" Bruce Hoffman , a Georgetown University terrorism scholar , told me "" It's way different than it was in the Bush years . The Obama administration has been trying to figure out how to counter it In October , Obama secretly ordered a review of the ways different agencies track travels between the United States and places like Pakistan to look for holes to close Napolitano told me : "" We can't operate in the paradigm that if they attack us , they would be coming from other countries into the United States We have some that are homegrown That is a change . After all the lawyerly focus on Guant ánamo and the rules of war , the latest threats put more focus on Obama in the role of commander in chief It did not go unnoticed that when he accepted the Nobel Peace Prize , he declared that "" evil does exist in the world . After the Christmas Day plot , his press secretary , Robert Gibbs , consciously or not , used the term "" war on terror . The White House then dispatched Brennan for a blitz of four Sunday shows , the first such foray for the C . I . A veteran Obama made almost as many statements about terrorism in the two weeks following Christmas as he did in the 11 months preceding it , not counting those focused on Afghanistan "" Our nation is at war , "" Obama declared on Jan . 2 "" We are at war , "" he said five days later as he released reports on the Detroit plot The war goes on , abroad and at home "
0,"The core beliefs of racism are that individuals can be divided into different categories based on the behaviour , or economic and political success of some individuals within the group of individuals Researchers have found that these assumptions are incorrect It has been found that there are more differences within the groups than differences between groups Racism primarily affects people of colour Around the 1900s , Black people were discriminated against in Canada and the U . S The first Black person to arrive in Canada was named Mathieu de Costa , an interpreter to the Micmac Nation Costa arrived in the year of 1608 Ever since then , racism has grown to become a big problem In America for centuries , Black people were slaves owned by White people Degradation , violence , mistreatment and malnutrition , were features of Black people's lives under slavery The first slave that arrived in Canada was named Oliver Le Jeune in 1628 Oliver was captured at the age of six and was sent to Canada This is an example of how slaves were captured and forced into slavery regardless of age Slaves were used to do chores for White families They were treated horribly Today , people of colour still face racism and stereotypes Chinese people are assumed to be smart , intelligent , short , and "" yellow . Having small eyes would have people automatically assuming you're Chinese ( or Asian ) Assumptions are why Trayvon Martin was shot and killed Trayvon Martin was a 17 - year-old teenage boy who is from Miami , Florida He was on the youth football team at school On February 26th , George Zimmerman was driving around the town and assumed Trayvon was dangerous only because he was young black man who had a hood on He found that Trayvon was "" suspicious . Zimmerman felt threatened so he decided to shoot Trayvon Zimmerman explained to the police that it was self-defence Young Black boys are assumed to be aggressive , dangerous and up to no good This is an example of a stereotype Black people go through They are assumed to be "" dangerous . White people are always assumed to be rich Blonde girls are assumed to be dumb Muslim people who grow beards are assumed to be terrorists only because of what happened during 9 These are some stereotypes of different groups of people Looking back on the history of the 1800s , overt racism was everywhere , and slavery was a major part of society If the families were not happy with their slaves they were able to sell them Harriet Tubman was a runaway slave who freed over 70 slaves with the Underground Railroad Black people did not have equal rights as White people ; this included the right to vote , schooling , employment , or the right to go to certain public places Everything they did was limited and controlled White people had much more freedom than Black people Since Black people were captured over to Canada and turned into slaves , they did not make a good living They worked all day and night cleaning and taking on commands their masters demanded them to do They were not fed full meals because they were only fed left-over dinner from their masters The slaves were not treated with respect , they were beaten and whipped by their masters if they were to do something wrong or if they were to disobey commands Eventually , after the abolition of slavery , and after the civil rights struggles of the 1950s and 1960s , Black people started to receive the same rights as White people They were able to vote , able to go to public locations without any difficulties , and they were also able to go to the same school as White people Some things about racism have changed for the better Now , there are organizations and laws that have been formed to work against discrimination against , and unequal treatment of , people of colour The Charter of Rights and Freedoms , Human Rights legislation , and hate laws are evidence of this change Even though it may be impossible to entirely prevent the amount of racism and discrimination people of colour receive , some improvements are possible The Ontario Human Rights Commission is an organization that tries to interact with individuals who feel like they have been discriminated against due to their skin , sex , religion , age , family status , disability , etc They try to decrease the amount of discrimination people face and they try to make a change for citizens Even though these organizations exist and overt racism isn't as common anymore , there are also things that have not changed , like the racist thoughts and racist comments people still have in mind Although these are more difficult to eliminate , there have been other positive changes to race relations "
0,"Recently , chilling videos surfaced online of young University of Oklahoma students , members of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity , reciting a racially-charged chant The story appeared surprising for numerous reasons Among them , education is supposed to reduce racial resentment ( or at least temper outward expressions of it ) , and young people , known as Millennials , are supposed to be uniquely tolerant The incident offers an opportunity to reevaluate how we think about racism in America , and how we can fight it The pervasive narrative about racial change is that it occurs through generations — old racists die out , and new , young , progressive people take their place This narrative is dubious Age tells us far less about an individual's likelihood of expressing racist sentiments than factors like education , geography and race The data below visualize the percentage of whites in each age group espousing the explicitly racist idea that blacks are not hardworking or intelligent , as well as the percentage who say that blacks face little or no discrimination Finally , I include the percentage of whites in each age group who say they have "" never "" felt admiration for blacks The youngest whites ( 17-34 ) are only modestly less likely than the oldest ( 65 + ) to say that blacks are lazy ( 3.6 point difference ) or unintelligent ( 1.5 point difference ) , but they are also less likely to perceive discrimination against blacks ( 6.3 point difference ) and far less likely to say that have felt admiration for blacks Compared to the generation immediately before them ( white aged 35-49 ) the youngest whites are slightly more likely to say blacks are lazy ( 2.4 points ) and unintelligent ( 4.3 ) In sum , it's clear that age has little effect on the likelihood that whites hold racially-biased feelings about blacks ""It's possible that these attitudes are simply driven by an individual's pessimism Maybe they feel that all people , white and black , are unintelligent But this does not exculpate young whites Spencer Piston , a professor at the Campbell Institute at Syracuse University , examined how young whites ranked the intelligence and work ethic of whites to blacks He finds that 51 percent of whites between the ages of 17 and 34 rate blacks as lazier than whites , and 43 percent say blacks are less intelligent These numbers aren't statistically different from older whites On issues related to structural racism , it is incredibly clear that young whites aren't very different from their parents Indeed , the most significant change that has occurred is an increasing conservatism among young blacks The data show that most young Americans are racial conservatives – they believe , in the words of Chief Justice John Roberts , "" The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race . We might call them the Bill O'Reilly Generation One of the underlying problems is that most Americans , but particularly Millennials , have a very confined view of what racism is Americans think of racism as Bull Connor or the Ku Klux Klan , but today , racism is far more likely to be embedded in institutions Modern racism isn't cross-burning ( though that still happens . ""It's the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs only approving tax credits for housing in neighborhoods that are majority people of color and denying the credits in neighborhoods that are majority white ( a case the Supreme Court will take up this year ) And while the Ferguson Police Department certainly contained racists , the more pervasive problem was a systematically discriminatory method of policing that preyed on people of color Age tells us far less about an individual's likelihood of expressing racist sentiments than factors like education , geography and race It is beyond dispute that the United States contains deep structural racial issues These racial disparities are perpetuated not only through explicit discrimination , but through the power of history For instance , black and Latino children are far more likely to grow up in poor neighborhoods , stinting upward mobility Black and Latino men are disproportionately caught up in mass incarceration , which affects their families and their earning for a lifetime A new report by Demos and Brandeis University finds that equalizing college graduation rates between whites and people of color would close the wealth gap by 1 percent for blacks and 3 percent for Latinos A recent study helps explain why : Michael Gaddis finds blacks who graduated from elite universities have the same chance in the job market as whites who graduated from less selective schools In addition , black graduates are offered lower starting salary and less prestigious starting jobs The reaction to the SAE scandal , and numerous other events over the past few years ( Donald Sterling and Paula Deen , for example ) suggest that our society can accurately identify and shame explicit racial animosity But addressing the structural racism that plagues our society will be far more difficult , mainly because most Americans aren't attuned to it Even progress can entrench structural racism In the wake of President Obama's election , political scientists Nicholas Valentino and Ted Brader found that Americans , particularly young Americans and white Americans , were less likely to perceive racial discrimination than they were before Further , University of Michigan professor Vincent Hutchings found that "" blacks and whites remain as far apart on racial policy matters in 2008 as in 1988 . In the long term , Americans need to grapple with our history and how it continues to affect us today Matthew Blackwell , Avidit Acharya and Maya Sen find that whites in areas with a high concentration of slavery are to this day more likely to espouse racially biased attitudes Therefore , waiting for a mass opinion change may take decades ( if it occurs at all ) Similarly , waiting for old whites to die out won't solve the problem , as these attitudes are equally prevalent among youth Demographic change may lead to a more diverse nation , but this will take half a century , and white hegemony has a way of shifting to accommodate new realities Racial justice must include more deeply integrating our neighborhoods to give everyone equal opportunity In addition , such integration will decrease racial animosity Mass incarceration and racially-biased policing tactics must be ended immediately The need to close the funding gap between majority white schools and schools that are majority students of color , as well as the gap between rich schools and poor schools should be immediately obvious A baby bond program could ease not just the racial wealth gap , but the deep-class divide in asset ownership And any racial justice policy must include full employment These programs need not be framed as part of a racial justice agenda Rather , they are part of an opportunity agenda , for all Americans , white , Black or Latino Correction : An earlier version of this post misidentified the research of University of Michigan professor Vincent Hutchings Hutchings found that blacks and whites remained as far apart on racial policy matters in 2008 as they did in 1988 Political scientists Nicholas Valentino and Ted Brader's research showed that Americans were less likely to perceive racial discrimination after President Obama was elected than they were before "

0,"""It's not just anger over jobs and immigration White voters hope Trump will restore the racial hierarchy upended by Barack Obama "" First they ignore you , then they laugh at you , then they fight you , then you win , "" goes the line attributed to Mahatma Gandhi Typically , you'll find this pearl adorning a classroom or splashed across a motivational poster But last month , on the eve of Super Tuesday — when a dozen states cast ballots for the Republican presidential nomination — you could find it on Donald Trump's Instagram page , the caption to a photograph of a massive rally in Alabama the day before Perverse as it may seem for the belligerent real estate magnate to channel even apocryphal Gandhi wisdom , the line is apt First , we did ignore him — as a buffoon who wouldn't survive past the summer Then , we laughed at him — as a buffoon who wouldn't survive through fall Eventually , Republicans began to fight him , terrified of his traction with voters Now , he's winning , with more votes and delegates than anyone left in the field On the eve of another critical Tuesday slate of votes , Trump is on the verge of an even greater victory Polls show him in command both in the smaller states that will award their delegates proportionally , and in the larger , winner-take-all prizes of Ohio and Florida By Wednesday morning , Trump could be a stone's throw from the Republican presidential nomination ""We've learned , by now , not to underestimate Donald Trump , but we're still struggling to understand his rise Why now Why , when the United States is stronger and wealthier than it's been since the Great Recession , are some voters suddenly receptive to nativist demagoguery How is Trump — who has been described as a proto-fascist , if not an outright fascist — just a few steps away from leading the Grand Old Party For some on the left , Trump is the result of decades of divisive politics — the inevitable outcome of a Republican political strategy that stoked white racial resentment to win elections "" Trump's campaign can best be understood not as an outlier but as the latest manifestation of the Southern Strategy , which the Republican Party has deployed for a half-century to shore up its support in the old Confederate states by appeals to racial resentment and white solidarity , "" writes Jeet Heer in the New Republic For some on the right , Trump is the grassroots response to Republican elites who have abandoned their working-class voters to the whims of laissez-faire capitalism "" [ T ] he Republican Party , and the conservative movement , offer next to nothing to working-class Trump supporters , "" writes Michael Brendan Dougherty in the Week "" There are no obvious conservative policies that will generate the sort of growth needed to raise the standard of living for these working-class voters . These explanations aren't mutually exclusive ; each touches on an important element of the Trump phenomenon The Republican Party does have a tradition of harnessing white racial resentment to win elections , from the infamous "" welfare queen "" rhetoric of Ronald Reagan to Newt Gingrich labeling Barack Obama the "" food stamp president "" during the 2012 presidential election GOP elites have failed to offer solutions to struggling working-class whites , who have suffered keenly from the collapse of the industrial economy And it is true that rapid , disorienting economic and cultural change has led a substantial group of Americans to turn to someone who disdains feckless politicians and pledges to restore the country's strength But none of these theories answer the question why now Each of these forces has been in play for years Wages for working-class Americans have long been stagnant , and the collapse of job opportunities for workers without a college degree was apparent in the 1990s , long before the Great Recession ""What's more , economic and social decline — as well as frustration with foreign competition , which Trump has channeled in his campaign — isn't unique to white Americans Millions of Americans — blacks and Latinos in particular — have faced declining economic prospects and social disintegration for years without turning to a demagogue like Trump Race plays a part in each of these analyses , but its role has not yet been central enough to our understanding of Trump's rise Not only does he lead a movement of almost exclusively disaffected whites , but he wins his strongest support in states and counties with the greatest amounts of racial polarization Among white voters , higher levels of racial resentment have been shown to be associated with greater support for Trump All of which is to say that we've been missing the most important catalyst in Trump's rise What caused this fire to burn out of control The answer , I think , is Barack Obama There have been some conservative writers who have tried to hang Trump's success on the current president , pointing to his putatively extreme positions But in most respects , Obama is a conventional politician — well within the center-left of the Democratic Party Or at least , he's governed in that mode , with an agenda that sits safely in the mainstream Laws like the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and the Affordable Care Act weren't impositions from the far left ; they were built out of proposals from the right and left , passed by a majority of Congress that was elected to pursue solutions on health care and the economy Barack Obama is many things , but conservative rhetoric aside , he's no radical We can't say the same for Obama as a political symbol , however In a nation shaped and defined by a rigid racial hierarchy , his election was very much a radical event , in which a man from one of the nation's lowest castes ascended to the summit of its political landscape And he did so with heavy support from minorities : Asian Americans and Latinos were an important part of Obama's coalition , and black Americans turned out at their highest numbers ever in 2008 For liberal observers , this heralded a new , rising electorate , and — in theory — a durable majority "" The future in American politics belongs to the party that can win a more racially diverse , better educated , more metropolitan electorate , "" wrote Harold Meyerson in the Washington Post after the 2008 election "" It belongs to Barack Obama's Democrats . For millions of white Americans who weren't attuned to growing diversity and cosmopolitanism , however , Obama was a shock , a figure who appeared out of nowhere to dominate the country's political life And with talk of an "" emerging Democratic majority , "" he presaged a time when their votes — which had elected George W . Bush , George H . W Bush , and Ronald Reagan — would no longer matter More than simply "" change , "" Obama's election felt like an inversion When coupled with the broad decline in incomes and living standards caused by the Great Recession , it seemed to signal the end of a hierarchy that had always placed white Americans at the top , delivering status even when it couldn't give material benefits In a 2011 paper , Robin DiAngelo — a professor of multicultural education at Westfield State University — described a phenomenon she called "" white fragility . "" White Fragility is a state in which even a minimum amount of racial stress becomes intolerable , triggering a range of defensive moves , "" she writes "" These moves include the outward display of emotions such as anger , fear , and guilt , and behaviors such as argumentation , silence , and leaving the stress-inducing situation These behaviors , in turn , function to reinstate white racial equilibrium . DiAngelo was describing private behavior in the context of workplace diversity training , but her diagnosis holds insight for politics You can read the rise of Obama and the projected future of a majority nonwhite America as a racial stress that produced a reaction from a number of white Americans — and forced them into a defensive crouch You can see the maneuvering DiAngelo describes in the persistent belief that Obama is a Muslim — as recently as last fall , 29 percent of Americans held this view , against all evidence It is a way to mark Obama as "" other "" in a society where explicit anti-black prejudice is publicly unacceptable Consistent with this racialized fear and anxiety is the degree to which white Americans now see "" reverse discrimination "" as a serious problem in national life For its American Values Survey , the Public Religion Research Institute asks respondents whether "" discrimination against whites is a significant problem . In last year's survey , 43 percent of Americans — including 60 percent of working-class whites — said discrimination against whites had become as big a problem as discrimination against blacks and other minorities The anxieties DiAngelo describes , and the fears cataloged by the American Values Survey , have real political impact In a 2014 study , political scientists Maureen Craig and Jennifer Richeson tried to measure "" perceived status threat "" from a shift in racial demographics , surveying how people responded when informed that California is now home to more blacks , Hispanics , and Asians than non-Hispanic whites In other words , how do white Americans react to unrelated political questions when exposed to news of a "" majority-minority "" future The results were clear "" Making the majority-minority shift in California salient led politically unaffiliated white Americans to lean more toward the Republican Party , "" wrote Craig and Richeson Likewise , "" making the changing national racial demographics salient led white Americans ( regardless of political party affiliation ) to endorse both race-related and relatively race-neutral conservative policy positions more strongly . The Obama era didn't herald a post-racial America as much as it did a racialized one , where millions of whites were hyperaware of and newly anxious about their racial status For example , during a Marco Rubio rally before the New Hampshire primary in February , I spoke to a voter who , in her way , gave voice to this hyperawareness "" I think he's divided this country in many ways , "" said Lori , an older white woman , of Obama "" I know in a lot of places in America there's a divide in color … like , when I walk up to someone in the stores "" — she looked at me to emphasize what she means — "" I feel that they're wondering if I like them … I didn't feel that before I was accepting of everyone , and I hate that he brought that . This isn't the first time in our history that whites have worried about losing their pre-eminent status In the early 20th century , massive Southern and Eastern European immigration , as well as Chinese immigration in the American West , fueled nativism and white racism , and helped lead to the resurrection of the Ku Klux Klan The revived Klan organized millions of white Americans in a movement against immigrants , blacks , and religious minorities like Catholics This , along with a broader nativist movement , had an enormous impact on American politics — entire states , like Indiana , were controlled by Klan-backed politicians while national lawmakers passed harsh , restrictive immigration laws Our current burst of nativism and racial anxiety is proving to be a similarly potent force "" The election of the country's first black president had the ironic upshot of opening the door for old-fashioned racism to influence partisan preferences after it was long thought to be a spent force in American politics , "" wrote Brown University political scientist Michael Tesler in a 2013 paper titled "" The Return of Old Fashioned Racism to White Americans ' Partisan Preferences in the Early Obama Era . For Tesler , "" old-fashioned racism "" isn't a rhetorical term ; it refers to specific beliefs about the biological and cultural inferiority of black Americans His work suggests that there are some white Americans who , in his words , have "" concerns about the leadership of a president from a racial group whom they consider to be intellectually and socially inferior . Other research points to the degree to which Obama's election seems to have exacerbated racial animus among white voters In a paper titled "" The Impact of Anti-Black Racism on Approval of Barack Obama's Job Performance and on Voting in the 2012 Presidential Election , "" a trio of researchers found a substantial increase in the number of voters with anti-black attitudes , which rose from 47.6 percent in 2008 to 50.9 percent in 2012 "" The proportion of people expressing anti-Black attitudes , "" they write , "" was 32 percent among Democrats , 48 percent among independents , and 79 percent among Republicans . What does anti-black racism in the Obama era have to do with Donald Trump , who crashed the 2016 campaign with a wave of anti-Latino rhetoric Trump may have started this campaign by denigrating Latinos and Muslims , but his first appearance in the Obama era was in the context of anti-black racism In 2011 , Trump took the "" birtherism "" conspiracy — the belief that Obama is foreign-born and thus an illegitimate president — and turned it into a full-fledged movement Even now , his supporters believe Obama is illegitimate — 62 percent say he is a Muslim , and 61 percent that he was born in another country I spoke to a voter who echoed this sort of othering anti-Obama rhetoric in Las Vegas , at a Trump event the day before the Nevada caucuses "" In my opinion , Obama is the most anti-American president that I have experienced He bows down to every other country He puts other countries before America , "" explained Martin , a staunch backer of the real estate mogul More recently , anti-black racism has returned to the fore , with behavior that attracts those who would like to see the old racial hierarchy restored He shares racist memes on Twitter and has built a symbiotic relationship with white nationalists , refusing a chance to repudiate former Klan leader David Duke during one interview and offering his son for an interview with a white-nationalist radio host And in recent weeks , Trump supporters have attacked black protesters at his rallies At an event in North Carolina , a protester was punched in the face by an audience member , while another yelled a racist slur Afterwards , Trump condoned the behavior "" He was swinging , he was hitting people , and the audience hit back , "" he said , despite no evidence of any attack from the protester "" That's what we need more of . In St . Louis , Missouri , a Trump rally collapsed into scuffles between supporters and opponents , with multiple arrests At a Kentucky rally — the same day Trump promised to defend supporters in court if they fought with demonstrators — two protesters were assaulted by members of a white-supremacist group On Friday evening , demonstrators in Chicago held a mass rally against an impending Trump event , forcing the campaign to cancel Trump blamed the ensuing melee on "" thugs . None of this is to discount the material facts behind Trump's appeal to working-class whites The collapse of the industrial economy in the wake of the Great Recession caused real devastation The middle class has been losing ground for a long time , and there are few jobs for people without college degrees — or at least , few jobs that hold a path to mobility Even in places where new factories have cropped up , unions are sparse and wages are low , following a race-to-the-bottom among the towns and cities that vie for the remaining manufacturing jobs When economic desperation meets hopelessness — as we saw in the 1980s , when an earlier wave of deindustrialization ravaged the inner cities — the results are tragic The effects of these trends were highlighted in a widely analyzed study released last fall that showed rising mortality rates among middle - and working-class white Americans , the group that makes up Trump's main body of support Princeton University professor Anne Case and co-author Angus Deaton found that white working-class Americans are increasingly dying from suicide , alcohol abuse , and drugs "" In 1999 , "" writes Case for Quartz , "" people in this group died from accidental drug and alcohol poisonings at four times the rate of Americans with a bachelor's degree or more By 2013 , they were dying at seven times the rate of their better-educated peers In 2013 , they also committed suicide at more than twice the rate of people with more education , and died from alcoholic liver disease and cirrhosis at five times the rate of those with a college degree . These spikes in mortality are so large that , for whites aged 45 to 54 , they've lowered overall life expectancy Young whites , meanwhile , face rising rates of addiction and a corresponding increase in mortality Canvas a Trump event and you'll meet people who have seen these changes up close They are teachers , police officers , small-business owners , and city employees who hold the closest thing to middle-class jobs in the rural towns and older suburbs where Trump draws his most ardent support In the Michigan primary , for example , Trump won most of his votes from voters with incomes less than $ 50,000 ; in New Hampshire , he dominated among voters making less than $ 100,000 Everywhere , in fact , Trump is winning Republicans with modest middle-class incomes These somewhat better-off Americans have seen their friends and family fall into dependency , whether to drugs or alcohol or welfare They are both sympathetic to this plight — which is why Trump's call for more help for veterans and seniors resonates with them — but also frustrated and angry The country , and its leaders , made a promise : If you worked hard , you would get ahead But that didn't happen Instead , for millions of Americans , it was the reverse : They worked hard and fell behind ""They're afraid , for themselves and for their children Trump speaks for them "" What do we all want ? Trump asked at a rally on the eve of the Nevada caucus "" We want security We want a strong country . Those who feel insecurity most acutely have turned out to back the real estate mogul en masse With that said , perceptions of race inform their embrace of Trump as well In the recent past , holding the favored spot in our racial hierarchy brought benefits As historian and political scientist Ira Katznelson details in When Affirmative Action Was White : An Untold History of Racial Inequality in Twentieth-Century America , being white was traditionally a pathway to middle-class security , the key that won access to vital mortgage and education programs , as the federal government worked to build a white middle-class in the middle part of the 20th century Even after the civil rights movement and the end of formal discrimination against black Americans , it was still true that being white and middle-class offered protection from the worst of our economy's ravages Drugs , ghettos , and dependency existed among whites in pockets of the country , but they were popularly understood as black and Latino problems , not white ones Now , that isn't true Now , middle-class whites face addiction and dependence , which adds a racial element to economic anxiety , as the security provided by whiteness no longer exists for many Americans There are objections to this narrative ""It's possible , for example , that Obama's decision to push forward with liberal policies and to galvanize a liberal base produced an inevitable partisan backlash , of which Trump is part Had Obama governed more moderately , had he tried to find a space in his coalition for white working-class voters , then Trumpism might have stayed in the deep But this analysis ignores the extent to which Trump reflects specific choices by Republican and conservative elites From indulging anti-Obama conspiracy theories to attacking him as an enemy of the United States , conservatives chose to nurture resentment and anxiety and distill it into something potent You can draw a direct line to the rise of Trump from the racial hysteria of talk radio — where figures like Rush Limbaugh , a Trump booster , warned that Obama would turn the world upside down "" The days of [ minorities ] not having any power are over and they are angry , "" said Limbaugh to his audience "" They want to use their power as a means of retribution . It also ignores the degree to which these voters likely would have found this hypothetical partnership inimical to their conception of their interests Even if Obama had reached out , they would be mere partners in a larger coalition , when what they want is to be its driving force Trump speaks to that desire , signaling — in ways subtle and otherwise — that he plans to "" Make America Great Again "" by making the white American worker the center of his universe Throughout our history , a substantial minority of whites has responded to America's always-shifting racial and economic terrain with a primal fear of being dominated , of finding themselves at the bottom of the hierarchy ""It's one of the strongest forces in American life , and politicians and demagogues of many partisan stripes channeled it long before Donald Trump ; it's so strong that researchers have found a direct and robust connection between a given county's proportion of enslaved people before emancipation and its present-day Republican vote share The more slaves held in a given area , the more Republican votes The good news is that movements like Trump's tend to fade away The bad news is that , even in defeat , they are influential One antecedent to Trump — Alabama Gov George Wallace — never won a national party nomination But he had massive impact on the direction of national politics , giving Richard Nixon raw materials for his "" Southern Strategy "" of racial resentment that would shape and define American politics for the next four decades For Americans opposed to Trump , it's tempting to believe that his base is a shrinking part of America ; that these are the death throes of racial reaction Eventually , goes the thinking , they'll fade from view too That is wishful thinking America is a diverse country But it's still a predominantly white one , where a Trumpist movement can still encompass millions of voters And "" eventually "" might be a while In the space between now and then , Trumpism — the potent mix of open prejudice , nationalist aggression , and heterodox economic policy — could thrive In fact , it likely will , since the trends that produced Trump — a brittle economy , an ailing white working-class , an insecure white middle-class , a rising nonwhite population , political gridlock , and growing minority political power — are ongoing Given the more than uphill climb he would face in a general election , Trump the person might have an expiration date But Trumpism will enter the firmament of modern politics , a powerful current that will shape the future of the Republican Party , and the Democratic one too Trump came on the stage as a clown But whenever he leaves , he'll do it as a new icon of a familiar movement in American life "
0,"Gone is the overt , violent , and legal racism of my childhood in the 1960s ""It's been replaced by a subtler , still ugly version A week after Barack Obama was elected president in 2008 , I walked into my old hometown bar in central Florida to hear , "" Well if a nigger can be president , then I can have another drink Give me a whiskey straight up . Only one day in the town and I thought , "" Damn the south . I had returned home to bury my father , who had spent much of the 1950s and ' 60s fighting for civil rights in the south Consequently , my childhood was defined by race It was why our car was shot at , why threats were made to burn our house down , why some neighbors forbid me to play on their lawn , why I was taunted at school as a "" nigger lover "" It was nothing compared to what the blacks in town had to endure I was just residing in the seam of something much uglier It is also why I left as soon as I could , exercising an option few others had I eventually moved to New York City to work on Wall Street In the next 15 years I thought less about race It is possible to live in the northeast as a white liberal and think little about it , to convince yourself that most of the crude past is behind Outward signs suggest things are different now : I live in an integrated neighborhood , my kids have friends of all colors , and my old office is diverse compared to what I grew up with As many point out , America even has a black man ( technically bi-racial ) as president Soon after my father passed away , I started to venture beyond my Wall Street life , to explore parts of New York that I had only previously passed through on the way to airports I did this with my camera , initially as a hobby I ended up spending three years documenting addiction in the New York's Bronx neighborhood of Hunts Point There I was slapped in the face by the past In my Florida hometown , there is a train track that splits the town into two colors When we passed into the black section of town , even if I were lying in the back of the station wagon , I knew it The gravel roads would wake me , and I could basically smell poverty through the windows Crossing into Hunts Point in New York is the same , complete with a train track The roads are paved , but feel unpaved The stench of poverty has not changed much ( industrial waste rather than uncollected garbage ) , nor has its clamor or its destructive power Neither has the color of its residents : the poor side of town in New York is still almost entirely dark skinned It took me a few months of slow recognition , fighting a thought I did not want to believe : we are still a deeply racist country The laws on the books claim otherwise , but in Hunts Point ( and similar neighborhoods across the country ) , those laws seem like far away idyllic words that clash with the daily reality : everything is stacked against those who are born black or brown We as a nation applaud ourselves for having moved beyond race We find one or two self-made blacks or Hispanics who succeeded against terrible odds , and we elevate their stories to a higher position , and then we tell them over and over , so we can say , "" See , we really are a color blind nation . We tell their stories so we can forget about the others , the ones who couldn't overcome the long odds , the ones born into neighborhoods locked down by the absurd war on drugs , the ones born with almost even odds that their fathers will at some point be in jail , the ones born into neighborhoods that few want to teach in , neighborhoods scarce of resources We tell the stories of success and say : see anyone can pull themselves up by their bootstraps , further denigrating those who can't escape poverty It plays into the false and pernicious narrative that poverty is somehow a fault of desire , a fault of intelligence , a fault of skills No , poverty is not a failing of the residents of Hunts Point who are just as decent and talented as anyone else Rather it is a failing our broader society It took me seeing one black teen thrown against a bodega wall by cops , for no reason , to erase much of the image of seeing Obama elected It took the unsolved murder of a 15 - year-old Hunts Point girl , a girl my middle daughter's age , to make me viscerally understand how lucky my children are It took watching as one smart child grew from dreaming of college to dealing drugs to viscerally understand how lucky everyone in my old office is The barriers between Hunts Point and the rest of New York are not as high as they were between the white and black section of my hometown in the 1960s People can freely pass over them Practically , however , they are almost insurmountable Gone is the overt , violent , and legal racism of my childhood It has been replaced by a subtler version It is a racism that is easier to ignore , easier to deny , and consequently almost as dangerous "
0,"But racial disparities have existed for as long as this country has ""They're not new now that Donald Trump is using prejudice as a talking point Much ado has been made about how America appears to be stuck in a new era of politics marked by a shockingly ugly racial climate ""It's generally thought to have begun in the Obama years , reflected by the Tea Party surge into Congress in 2010 and represented now by Donald Trump's wild popularity Racism , the story goes , has gone from something kept in the dark margins of society and generally frowned upon to something regularly shouted from rooftops with pride But racial disparities have existed in healthcare , education , poverty rates and on almost every other structural level for as long as this country has existed Since when is saying something racist more of a problem than maintaining racist structures Is a climate only "" shockingly ugly "" if it puts words to shockingly ugly realities that are already here A recent CNN article explores the newly "" erupted "" white frustration with nonwhite ethnic groups , particularly black and immigrant communities , through a series of interviews Regarding Barack Obama , for instance , the article states : "" Many Trump supporters say he can't be trusted , he cares more about the welfare of black people than whites and he's inflamed racial divisions in the country Others say they're convinced that he's Muslim . ""It's not hard to read between the lines to see how this frustration is based not in response to how Obama threatens to privilege black people or Muslims , but on the idea that the supremacy of this almost entirely white group of supporters is being challenged It is not a lack of racial divisions they want , just a lack of divisions that do not benefit them And that sentiment was already present Yes , it's true that more attention has been drawn to blatant displays of racism , but attention is necessarily skewed by whatever is popular in the moment According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics , hate crimes stayed fairly stagnant from 2004 to 2012 , and the number of hate groups have actually fallen in recent years , according to the Southern Poverty Law Center Though relatively higher now , black unemployment rates have almost always been twice that of white rates All this stayed constant through this "" new era "" , which also saw interracial relationships and their supporters continually increase and a black president reelected with substantial white support The question , then , is not whether there has been an exacerbation of racial tensions , but rather : why are so many only paying attention now , and are they really paying attention to the things that matter Neither Trump nor his supporters ' nasty rhetoric exemplify the most obvious way racism is currently expressed in America This era's dominant form of racism is still best epitomized in the disregard – or ( feigned ) surprise – that it remains It is in only 16 % of white Americans agreeing with the statement that a lot of racism still exists It is in 63 % of white football fans believing that a black player is not a victim of racism when called a thug for celebrating similarly to how his white peers do without being defamed It is in how , right now , we frame the conversation about racism in American politics as represented by Trump as "" shocking "" , "" new "" or somehow vastly different than any previous iteration , when it is merely a different color lipstick for the same ugly pig The truth is white America's silence around racism is no longer working Organizations like Black Lives Matter and the Movement for Black Lives refuse to let it , shining light on all of the issues it would prefer to ignore In its place , a resistance to that challenge to pay attention gains traction It is reminiscent of the blatantly racist political response to Reconstruction after the civil war , but it is only more of the same Nonwhite communities have felt and challenged racism throughout , while many well-meaning white peoples ' only concern has been to cover it as much as possible , because the only other alternative would be the much more difficult task of destroying it Trump and his supporters disturb well-meaning white people not because they are racist , but because they do not bother to hide it Otherwise , Trump's white opponents would be just as disturbed with how racism has wreaked havoc on this country as with its ascendance into undisguised political rhetoric "
0,"In this serialized feature , Ali Al Saloom shares his insight and experiences from growing up in the UAE Eid is always a time we looked forward to when we were children It was a time when we'd have new clothes made for us and we'd get our hair cut so we'd look nice It was also a time when we'd be given money One Ramadan , when I was maybe six or seven years old , I remember my mum telling me to remind my father to collect my new kandura from the tailor We went to get it but it was always last minute and when we brought it home , the kandura was too short This was a day or two before Eid My father went to get it fixed but there was no time Then Eid came and I started crying , thinking my three sisters and four female cousins would make fun of me because I was a miskeen - a poor boy - in an old kandura and they were all in new dresses But even though it was last minute , my mother fixed it She got an old-fashioned sewing machine out of storage It was one that worked by hand - I didn't even know my mother was a good tailor She got my kandura and unpicked the hem at the bottom and made it longer so it fitted Until then I hadn't realized why the hems are so long in kanduras Then I had a fresh idea and I thought to myself : "" Maybe that means other people aren't making new kanduras . My father said : "" Who says that's a bad idea If the people are poor and can't afford it , some will do that ""It's why you have to say ' alhamdulillah ' - ' thanks to God ' - for having a new kandura . I also wondered why we don't give the old ones to the needy instead of throwing them away It was an amazing lesson , coming near the end of the Holy Month of Ramadan Just before Eid , it's traditional for everyone to get their hair cut so they look nice One time , when I was 8 years old , my mother gave me five dirhams and sent me to the barber , who was called Mukhtar The whole neighborhood in Bani Yas used to see him and his two brothers , who also worked at the barbers Their shop in Bani Yas was at the end of a row of shops and the first one I went past was one that sold sweets I went in and bought an ice cream for half a dirham So I now had four and a half dirhams left but the haircut cost five dirhams So what did I do I went in and spent another half a dirham buying a type of biscuit that had a card in it featuring a photo of a Disney character , which the kids used to barter and swap The neighborhood kids used to play a game where we'd hold up a pair of cards - one mine , the other belonging to the other kid - and let them drop The one whose card hit the ground first kept both cards I played with another boy so I could make up for only having four dirhams left of the money my mother gave me I was sure I'd make up for the money I'd spent before I reached the barber shop And I lost And yes , it's almost like I was gambling and that was haram - forbidden - in Islam but , oh well , I was a child and it was cool So I bought another one - and lost that one too Finally I only had three dirhams left I was in big trouble but , fortunately , we lived in our neighborhood like a family I went to the barber and inside there were 30 people waiting to get their hair cut by the three brothers It must have been 9pm before my turn came around I had Mukhtar and I said to him : "" Listen , Mukhtar , I only have three dirhams You tell my dad and he'll pay you the other two dirhams . He looked at me and said : "" No problem . He cut my hair for three dirhams When I got home , I asked my father for two dirhams and he gave them to me I went back to Mukhtar and paid him We woke up early the next day for the Eid Al Fitr prayer ""It's a special prayer at 6am that only happens once a year Our mother made sure we were there right on time When we got back from prayer was the time we all waited for , as on Eid Al Fitr everyone gives children money My father gave me and my sister money and my mother would , too Usually it would be five dirhams or more and when I was a child , to get Dh50 or Dh100 made us feel really rich But even two to three dirhams made us happy The children used to go around the neighborhood houses and be given money , then my father took us to visit his colleagues and some high official home majlises around the city in Abu Dhabi My father had five to seven main houses that he'd visit during Eid and share his greetings But to me it was five to seven big opportunities to get more "" eideyah "" - the money children are given by the people at these homes How long did my money last Are you kidding me It was gone the same day "
0,"In the past week , Donald Trump has been asked repeatedly about the Ku Klux Klan and its notorious former grand wizard , David Duke Trump still hasn't given voters the right answer Two weeks ago , Duke told people listening to his radio program to join Trump's campaign , saying , "" You're going to meet people who are going to have the same kind of mindset that you have . Since then , Trump has repeatedly said he disavows Duke and the Klan The problem is , that is the only thing Trump has said He hasn't explained why the Klan's white nationalism was wrong , and his disavowals are starting to sound somewhat perfunctory New polling data from the American National Election Studies suggests a few reasons that Duke might see sympathy for his cause among Trump's supporters Some of them appear to be worried about their status and identity as white Americans , a concern that has allowed him to build a broad electoral coalition that crosses the usual demographic and ideological boundaries within the Republican Party Maybe that is why questions about the Klan keep coming up for Trump , and why no one in the press seems to believe his disavowals He could easily make his stance on racism clear , but to this point , he has not done so A spokeswoman for Trump did not respond to a request for comment Contrast Trump's words with the kind of unequivocal , impassioned condemnations of white supremacy that other Republicans have offered Sen . Ted Cruz ( R-Tex . called the Klan "" abhorrent , "" writing , "" Racism is wrong . "" There is no room in the conservative movement and there is no room in the Republican Party for members of the Ku Klux Klan or racists like David Duke , "" Sen . Marco Rubio ( R-Fla . ) said "" If a person wants to be the nominee of the Republican Party , there can be no evasion and no games , "" said Rep . Paul Ryan ( R-Wis . ) "" They must reject any group or cause that is built on bigotry This party does not prey on people's prejudices . Contrast Trump with Rick Perry , the Republican former governor of Texas , who back in the summer gave a carefully considered speech on race and violence Perry began with a harrowing account of a lynching in Texas in 1916 Then he said the Republican Party needed to do more to confront its historical association with racism "" I know Republicans have much to do to earn the trust of African Americans , "" Perry said "" Blacks know that Republican Barry Goldwater in 1964 ran against Lyndon Johnson , who was a champion of civil rights They know that Barry Goldwater opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 States supporting segregation in the South cited ' states ' rights ' as a justification for keeping blacks from the voting booth and the dinner table . Contrast Trump's repeated insinuations that President Obama was not born in the United States with this line of Perry's : "" I am proud to live in a country that has an African American president . Trump has not been able to summon up such rhetoric All he can do , it seems , is repeat the word "" disavow . His comments are worth quoting at length "" How many times do I have to continue to disavow people ? he said Monday on NBC "" I disavowed David Duke Now if you look on Facebook , right after that I also disavowed David Duke When we looked at it and looked at the question , I disavowed David Duke So I've disavowed David Duke all weekend long . The question came up again at Trump's press conference following his victories in primaries on Tuesday "" Look , I disavowed I disavowed , "" he said before beginning to talk about the huge crowds he's getting on the campaign trail Then he came back to the subject at hand : I put out a tweet and I put out on Facebook that I totally disavow Now everybody knew I did that , but the press refused to look at that It was right after And I disavowed then I disavowed today on ABC with George Stephanopoulos I disavowed again I mean , how many times are you supposed to disavow But I disavow and hopefully it's the final time I have to do it Maybe it is unfair to expect Trump to offer more than this - - to expect him to say a few words to the effect that racism is wrong , or to explain how he'll broaden the party's appeal to voters of color if he's nominated After all , it's clear he doesn't take the accusation of racism seriously , so why should he bother to respond in detail Yet Trump was asked to do just that in Thursday night's debate on Fox Moderator Chris Wallace told Trump that everyone is aware that he disavows the Klan Instead , Wallace said he wanted to know more about Trump's views on racism "" You have repeatedly disavowed [ Duke ] , but I'd like to go deeper than that , "" Wallace said "" What are your views on the Ku Klux Klan , and white supremacists ? Trump didn't answer the question , instead simply repeating his earlier disavowal "" Obviously I'm going to disavow , "" he said Yet that was exactly Wallace's point : Of course , anyone running for office is going to disavow the Klan What voters still don't really know is how Trump thinks about the country's history of racial oppression It would be easy enough for him to clear this up , and it's no wonder that many people seem confused about where Trump stands Recent polling data shows that Trump's support is at least partially motivated by racial anxiety Last week , political scientists Michael Tesler and John Sides analyzed pilot data from the American National Election Studies , a recurring survey They noted that , among white independent and Republican supporters of Trump in the survey , one-third believe that there is "" a great deal "" of discrimination against white people in the United States today - - twice the share of those supporting other Republican candidates A majority - - 52 percent - - of Trump's supporters in the survey believe it is "" extremely important "" that white people work together to change laws that are unfair to people of their race , compared with 31 percent of white Republican and independent voters supporting other candidates Also last week , the news organizations Vox and Morning Consult released a detailed survey that shows Trump's supporters are also united by what psychologists call "" authoritarianism "" - - a set of related character traits including a preference for unwavering leadership , resistance to change , and aversion to cultural and racial differences The connection between authoritarianism and Trump's appeal is not as pronounced as the link between the belief that white status is threatened and support for Trump Nor are voters ' general feelings about immigration or the economy as useful in predicting whether or not they stand for Trump That said , Trump's supporters are particularly concerned about minorities in the labor force Among white Republican and independent respondents , 47 percent of Trump's supporters say it is at least "" very likely "" that many white workers are unable to get a job because businesses are hiring minorities , while just 22 percent of those supporting other candidates agree In all , the data suggest that Trump has created a new kind of Republican primary coalition Many of those who support him are white voters who are uncomfortable with the way America is changing demographically , and they believe that the status of people who look like them in society is in decline In the past , analysts have typically divided Republican primary voters into several groups : evangelical , moderate , secular and conservative , moderately conservative , and so on In Trump's coalition , these divisions are secondary For certain GOP voters , racial consciousness is more fundamental than their other commitments As Trump's success has shown , the faction that votes based on white racial identity - - while not a majority of the party - - can be the dominant one when there are several candidates competing for the nomination "
0,"In our faltering efforts to deal with race in this country , a great deal of time is devoted to responding to symptoms rather than root causes That may help explain why racism keeps repeating itself Exhibit One is the recurring cases of racism at colleges In February 2013 , Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity was suspended by Washington University in St . Louis after the fraternity's pledges were accused of singing racial slurs to African American students Last November , the University of Connecticut suspended Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity after a confrontation with members of the historically black Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority in which AKAs were called racially and sexually charged epithets This year in March , a University of Maryland student resigned from Kappa Sigma fraternity after being suspended for sending an e-mail containing racially and sexually suggestive language about African American , Indian and Asian women Also this year , disciplinary action was taken against members of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity at the University of Oklahoma who participated in a racist chant , caught on video , about lynching African Americans We have not seen the end of racist fraternity and sorority actions on college campuses ""That's because the actions taken in response to these incidents by well-meaning universities were directed at symptoms Epithets , chants and derogatory language about African Americans are indicators of an underlying problem within the offending white students , namely an antagonism against blacks based upon feelings of white superiority With suspensions and expulsions , the college community rids itself of a particular manifestation but not the underlying problem , which is racial prejudice The United States has been treating evidence of racism , and not the causes , since the Civil War Slavery ; "" separate but equal "" ; segregated pools , buses , trains and water fountains ; workplace and housing discrimination ; and other forms of bias and animus have served as painful barometers of the nation's racial health They have been , however , treated like the pain that accompanies a broken leg The effort was to treat or reduce the agonizing symptoms of the break rather than fix it The 13th , 14th and 15th amendments to the Constitution extended civil and legal protections to former slaves They eased the pain , but the leg was still broken Anti-lynching laws scattered the lynch mobs But the pain flared up again with beatings , bombings and assassinations Our nation responded to racial anguish with a variety of measures : the 1954 Brown school desegregation decision , the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , the 1965 Voting Rights Act and numerous rules and regulations to address those things that caused generations of African Americans — when the shades were drawn — to groan , weep , grit their teeth and swear that their children would not experience the demeaning , disrespectful and immoral treatment that they had to endure However , these legal remedies , while addressing the excruciating racial pain , didn't deal with the enduring problem : the racism itself that caused the South to secede from the Union ; that led state legislatures and governors to birth Jim Crow laws ; that sparked the KKK's reign of terror ; and that encouraged school districts and town zoning officials to institutionalize barriers against black citizens in housing , education and employment And racism is still at it in the 21st century All you have to do is look at those frat boys cited above to see that it's going strong Witness , too , the enactment of laws passed since President Obama's 2008 election to make it harder for African Americans to vote And then there is Dylann Roof , the alleged Charleston , S . C . , assassin who takes his place among storied anti-black murderers such as James Earl Ray , who killed the Rev Martin Luther King Jr . ; the Klansmen who bombed the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham , Ala . , killing four little black girls ; and Samuel H . Bowers Jr . , the imperial wizard of the Mississippi White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan , who with his KKK brethren murdered three civil rights workers Oh , yes , Roof has plenty of company ; not necessarily in his homicidal rage but in his ideology The manifesto that he purportedly wrote is replete with bigoted remarks common to right-wing talk radio and posted on Web sites Dylann Roof is this week's manifestation of our racial sickness But Roof and his ideological forbear President Jefferson Davis of the Confederate States of America and those Sigma Alpha Epsilon brothers are symptoms of the same problem Until we get at the root cause , the problem lives on "
0,""" UNDESCRIBABLE . "" UNFATHOMABLE . "" Unspeakable . "" Beyond incomprehensible . Charleston officials struggled Thursday morning to find words to describe the shooting at a historic African American church in which nine people were killed They were not alone Much of America was grappling with the calculated murder of people gathered for prayer in a house of worship That the gunman was apparently motivated by racial hatred sharpened the horror The first response to Wednesday night's massacre at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church must be to think of the victims , their families and their community Six women and three men — including the church's pastor , the Rev Clementa Pinckney , who was also a state senator — were killed and at least one person was injured by a white male assailant who sat through an hour of the prayer service and then opened fire , allegedly making racial comments "" The heart and soul of South Carolina was broken , "" South Carolina Gov Nikki Haley ( R ) said of the grieving of families and pain of the community It was also natural for there to be relief that the suspect , identified as 21 - year-old Dylann Roof , was quickly apprehended His arrest followed an extraordinary mobilization of law enforcement and a tip from a good citizen , both reflecting the outrage over this heinous act But even as the nation reels and mourns , there must be consideration of how such a crime could occur That a person so young could feel — and act out — such hatred is a sad reminder that the United States , for all its progress , is far from closing the book on the racial divisions that warped much of its history Equally perverse is how easy this country makes it for guns to fall into the wrong hands Good that both Charleston Mayor Joseph P . Riley Jr . ( D ) and President Obama gave voice to that issue Thursday Mr . Riley was visibly angry in talking about the lack of a major national effort to tighten gun laws The president , by contrast , appeared weary , and little wonder considering how often he has had to speak to the nation after mass shootings : 13 people killed at a Binghamton , N . Y . , community center ; 13 people killed and another 30 shot at Fort Hood in Texas ; six people killed in Tucson in a shooting that grievously injured a congresswoman ; 12 people killed and 58 wounded in a Colorado movie theater ; 20 Sandy Hook Elementary School students and six of their educators killed Nor is that even a complete list "" At some point , "" Mr . Obama said , "" we as a country will have to reckon with the fact that this type of mass violence does not happen ... in other places with this kind of frequency . Expanding background checks or shutting down unscrupulous gun dealers would not prevent every incident , but they are sensible steps that would reduce the violence But , as Mr . Obama said , "" the politics of this town foreclose a lot of those avenues right now . So instead of acting , we add one more name to a roster of grief and outrage : Tucson Aurora Newtown Charleston "
0,"If American racism were a thing of the past , nine men and women who went to church last Wednesday evening would be alive What happened in Charleston , S . C . , is not unfathomable or even ambiguous ""It's a story much older than the nation , a story that began when the first Africans were brought to Jamestown in 1619 : the brutalizing and killing of black people because of the color of their skin The weekend displays of multiracial unity throughout the saddened city were inspiring , but they cannot be taken as a sign that the country has moved beyond its troubled racial past The gunman who so coldly killed those innocent worshipers at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church did not exist in a vacuum He inhaled deeply of the race hatred that constantly bubbles up like foul gas from a sewer The alleged assassin , Dylann Roof , left behind a manifesto that said he drew inspiration from the Web site of the Council of Conservative Citizens , a prominent white supremacist group The organization's proudly racist "" statement of principles "" declares that "" the American people and government should remain European in their composition and character "" and opposes "" all efforts to mix the races of mankind . The Southern Poverty Law Center , which tracks hate groups , describes the council as a modern-day incarnation of the "" White Citizens Councils "" throughout the South that fought so tenaciously against desegregation during the civil rights era The council's membership is thought to be small but its reach is vast , thanks to the Internet Like hateful jihadists , white supremacists use cyberspace as a bulletin board and a meeting place Come on in , young Mr Roof , and let us tell you how those black people and those brown people are responsible for everything that's going wrong in your life Some conservatives have been quick to absolve society of blame by pointing out that the accused Charleston shooter was mentally disturbed But of course he was mentally disturbed ; normal , well-adjusted individuals do not commit mass murder And the fact is that the Charleston killings were intended to advance a specific cause To look past Roof's racism would be like ignoring the fact that the Tsarnaev brothers , who committed the Boston Marathon bombing , believed in a violent , twisted version of Islam "" You rape our women , and you're taking over our country , "" Roof reportedly said to his victims before opening fire This sick narrative comes straight from the Council of Conservative Citizens Web site , which inflates isolated incidents of black-on-white crime into some kind of race war and portrays the nation's "" European heritage "" as being in dire peril President Obama chose an unusual forum — a podcast with comedian Marc Maron — to deliver his most candid remarks since the Charleston massacre Race relations have clearly improved in our lifetimes , he said , but "" we are not cured "" of racism "" and it's not just a matter of it not being polite to say ' nigger ' in public . Slavery and Jim Crow discrimination cast "" a long shadow , and that's still part of our DNA that's passed on . ""Obama's election in 2008 undoubtedly marked a milestone , one I never dreamed I'd live to see I wrote at the time that it felt like morning in America What I didn't fully appreciate then was the extent to which the mere fact of a black family living in the White House would , at least in the short term , heighten racial anxieties and conflicts I didn't see that the spectacle of African Americans in power would apparently lead some whites to feel powerless , aggrieved and victimized In the long run , I'm an optimist But a post-racial future will not just appear There is urgent work to do By all means , South Carolina , get rid of the Confederate battle flag , which has become an emblem of the white supremacist movement The flag first flew over the state house in Columbia in 1961 , not 1861 ; it was essentially an act of defiance , a raised middle finger toward a federal government that was forcing the end of Jim Crow But we need to go beyond speeches and symbols Law enforcement should subject white racist organizations to the same surveillance and scrutiny as groups devoted to jihad Governments at all levels should enforce fair housing and employment laws as vigorously as they enforce the Patriot Act Police departments and court systems must be compelled to administer justice equally — with African Americans , too , considered innocent until proven guilty Our society will end racism when it stops being racist Not a minute sooner "
0,"The UEFA Champions League and UEFA Cup are the flagship European club competitions - and the whole world will be watching Paul Saffer reports on UEFA's efforts to rid the game of racism during the new season The UEFA Champions League and UEFA Cup are the flagship European club competitions - and the whole world will be watching With such an audience , UEFA are determined that the spectre of racism will not raise its head during the new season It has long been a mission of UEFA to stamp out prejudice of all kinds throughout the European game and to support all organisations dedicated to that end - the Football Against Racism in Europe ( FARE ) week in October being a particular case in point And since the arrival of Michel Platini as UEFA President and David Taylor in the role of UEFA General Secretary , that commitment has been particularly emphasised "" Football owes itself to be an example in our societies , "" Mr Platini said prior to the UEFA Champions League group stage draw in Monaco "" Football must teach values to Europe - honesty , courage , fraternity , tolerance and peace Football includes , integrates , and welcomes It excludes no one , it discriminates against no one , it persecutes no one The battle that we have undertaken against racism and discrimination is a combat which will only stop when these phenomena have disappeared from our stadiums With the [ UEFA ] Executive Committee , we will continue to be intransigent . Therefore , there will be no tolerance for those who use racist language "" I don't know who they are , I don't know what interest they have in football , "" Mr Taylor said "" They are not welcome in football or anywhere near it UEFA has its approach to these problems We will kick clubs out of European competitions , even national teams if players or supporters act in a racist way These sort of sanctions are there and UEFA will not be afraid to use them if the circumstances are serious enough So we have no tolerance for racist behaviour . Punishment is not the only strand to UEFA's anti-racism stance Working with FARE and similar bodies has been a cornerstone for some years , and Mr Taylor confirmed that such support , financial and through the use of UEFA's influence and reputation , remains a central pillar "" On the more positive side , we do need to work with and are working with and providing financial support to organisations who are continually leading the campaign , the publicity campaign , "" he said "" It's important we use top players and coaches to demonstrate to those interested in football that the leaders of our game want this out of football completely . This is not about eradicating passion from football supporting , of course , but it is about leaving no doubt where the line is drawn between a fans ' free speech and unacceptable abuse In his Monaco speech , Mr Platini explained : "" When a forward misses a certain goal , when a goalkeeper makes an error with a simple shot , this is totally acceptable But racism and violence in football are completely unacceptable in football - there must be zero tolerance . The UEFA President concluded with a rallying cry : "" We have already taken severe measures , and we will continue to take them while we have not eradicated this scourge ... Do not submit to the blackmail of certain groups who only represent themselves Make the effort to implement a system of qualified stewards Only recognize supporters ' associations which clearly and unambiguously reject violence and racism Together , let us change football and make it more united , more fraternal and more fun to enjoy .

Strine Jr . , who formed a committee exploring ways to reduce racial disparities in Delaware prisons , encouraged fellow panelists and audience members at Tabernacle Full Gospel Baptist Church to avoid using racially charged language — specifically the term "" white supremacy . He argued it makes some white people defensive , and has a tendency to shut down well-intentioned conversations Social activists and academics often use the term white supremacy to describe a society that favors whites over other races White supremacy also has been used to describe the activities of the Ku Klux Klan and Aryan Brotherhood — hate groups that target primarily African Americans , but also , according to the Southern Poverty Law Center , Jews , immigrants , gays and lesbians Strine worried that frequent use of the term might be offensive to some , and undermine efforts to bring people together "" When they hear this rhetoric , they somehow take it personally , "" Strine said "" Please try to talk to each other in a respectful way that builds bridges . The response was swift and critical "" I use that word because that is what it is , "" said Shefon Taylor , a Delaware civil rights activist and panelist that night "" I know that makes some of us uncomfortable ... but it is OK to sit in the discomfort . In a later interview , Strine said he does not want to limit freedom of expression but hopes people understand that words are powerful — and that they can either build relationships or set back progress "" It is a rich conversation to talk about common ground , but we cannot start the conversation with words that ... stop people from listening , "" he said This disagreement illustrates how language used to talk about race is rooted in history , and can be divisive and uncomfortable , academics say "" There is a huge racial divide in the language we use , "" said University of Connecticut sociology professor Noel Cazenave "" It seems European-Americans and African-Americans are on different planets It makes it impossible to have a serious national dialogue . The result can be sanitized and evasive language , said Cazenave To avoid uncomfortable conversations , white people say they don't see color ; they talk about "" the race issue "" when they mean racism and oppression ; and they try to rewrite the Black Lives Matter movement as All Lives Matter , Cazenave said "" Words matter , "" Cazenave said "" Any system of oppression is typically held together by words African-Americans have been told what words we can use , and how to express our concerns in order to be listened to , but now is the time for people who are racially oppressed to insist we have a right to express our concerns about our condition in the terms we want . Others , however , say progress is possible only if language is tailored based on the setting to be more inclusive of non-blacks who may want to be part of the conversation but are uncomfortable and new to it "" We want people to stay at the table , "" said Larry Davis , founding director of the University of Pittsburgh's Center on Race and Social Problems "" So let's not get into the semantics . The national conversation on race has heated up since 2013 It started with the acquittal of George Zimmerman , a neighborhood watch coordinator in a Florida community , for the shooting death of Trayvon Martin , a black teen The social media hashtag #BlackLivesMatter emerged in response to the acquittal , and has continued to pop up in response to highly publicized cases of police using deadly or excessive force against blacks "" It has become an umbrella that folks in different communities can organize behind , "" said Lecia Brooks , an outreach director at the Southern Poverty Law Center "" It came out of Eric Garner , Michael Brown — all of those cases . Having these daily national conversations about race can be difficult and uncomfortable , many academics and social justice activists told The News Journal , but the conversations are vital to creating a more just society Just this week , the trial began in Baltimore for one of six officers charged in the death of a black man , Freddie Gray , in police custody The city erupted in riots in April when Gray died of a spinal cord injury At the same time , a jury in Delaware is contemplating whether a Dover police officer is guilty of second-degree assault for kicking a black suspect in the head , knocking him unconscious And , the Access to Justice Commission's Committee on Fairness had the first public comment sessions in Delaware in an effort to find solutions to the disproportionate number of African Americans in the criminal justice system "" America is being confronted with some of its sins , "" Davis said "" America hasn't had to do that ever . This dialogue is making it more obvious that America is not a post-racial country , and that even though the president is black and the Civil Rights Act was passed more than 50 years ago , racism still plays a major role in everything from the criminal justice system to education to housing , academics say A recent Kaiser Family Foundation and CNN survey of Americans found that 35 % of blacks and a quarter of Hispanics report experiencing discrimination because of their race , either by being denied a job for which they are qualified , being denied housing they could afford , or being prevented from voting Only 11 % t of whites reported the same experiences The study also found that about two-thirds of blacks and Hispanics say racism is a big problem in this country , but only 43 % of whites say it is Some scholars have started to call this Racism 2.0 — the idea that racism still exists but is far more subtle and hidden in society \u200b "" When we talk about racism or white supremacy , the immediate image is the KKK , or the burning of a cross , or a small-town country bigot , or maybe Donald Trump these days , "" said Arizona State University professor Lee Bebout "" Unfortunately , that says white supremacy is unusual and over there , as opposed to white supremacy being something systemic and part of everyday reality . Many academics , as well as Chief Justice Strine , have pointed to growing research that says everyone has unconscious biases , even if few are willing to admit to them Rev Patricia Downing , of Trinity Episcopal Parish in Wilmington , said society can begin to correct its wrongs by people becoming more aware of these unconscious biases , such as by having judges , prosecutors and public defenders in the criminal justice system undergo bias training or having people take a Harvard University online test that gauges implicit biases "" When we are more self-aware , we can be more compassionate and empathetic , "" she said "" Then we can take steps to break down those systems that cause suffering . Unconscious biases can make it difficult at times for some people who are white to discuss privileges they have been afforded throughout their lives because of their race , Cazenave said "" European-Americans want to think that what they got they earned , and they didn't get it from white racial privilege , "" Cazenave said Bebout agreed , saying white people often find it easier to talk about black oppression , but not its counterpart , which is white privilege Bebout was condemned in January by a Fox News commentator and attacked on the Internet over a course he taught called "" U . S . Race Theory & the Problem of Whiteness . Even under fire , he has continued to teach the class because he believes certain words in the race dialogue , such as "" whiteness "" or "" white supremacy , "" should not be sanitized or banned Instead , people who are uncomfortable with those words should listen and be open to understanding , he said "" You cannot just say here are the linguistic ground rules , and now let's talk You have to go at it with a willingness to talk and come with an open mind and open heart , "" said James M . Jones , director of the Center for the Study of Diversity and a professor at the University of Delaware Most agree that the ongoing conversation about race is positive , as long as people are allowed to speak freely "" This national conversation forces us to confront our own relationship , "" said Jennifer Stollman , of the Winter Institute for Racial Reconciliation The Winter Institute hosts race conversations for communities in Mississippi , and during those conversations , works to ensure everyone is listening , suspending judgment , and speaking their truths while respecting the truths of others "" If you are really interested in solving problems with the legacy of racism , you don't get to control the language , "" she said "" People of color have a right to frame the perspective in the way they see it , they have a right to be angry and they have a right to have their voices heard , even if it causes discomfort . Many say when there is controversy or disagreement over language , it shouldn't be interpreted as a setback Strine agreed that these conversations are difficult but important "" We've got to keep coming back to the table , "" Stollman said "" Each of those conversations reaches us closer and closer to reconciliation . Rev Donald Morton , associate pastor at Tabernacle Full Gospel Baptist Church in Wilmington , which hosted the town hall meeting Strine participated in , said he agrees that uncomfortable conversations need to continue "" We have to learn to be comfortable with being uncomfortable , "" Morton said "" These conversations are uncomfortable because most times we are unwilling to embrace the horrific history of America and present of America . Yasser Payne , a professor at the University of Delaware who was on the panel last month with Strine , said finding common language begins with these conversations "" Through that tension , we grow , we evolve , we find common language that makes sense , "" he said "
0,"Jocelyn Briddell remembers feeling paralyzed several years ago during a dinner conversation with co-workers at a colleague's home that took on an unexpected racial overtone Over an elaborate homemade Italian spread , her colleague's husband launched into a lengthy monologue in which he denigrated Jews , Latinos , African-Americans , Mexicans and lesbians – despite having guests that included two Jewish women , a lesbian and Briddell , who is African-American "" We were all just sitting there looking at one another , frozen , "" Briddell says Finally after an hour and a half Briddell went to the bathroom and looked in the mirror , thinking "" what are you doing ? She and her co-workers left , drove a block away and got out of their cars to talk about what happened "" We were stunned at ourselves for not saying anything , "" says Briddell , now executive director at the Scarritt Bennett Center in Nashville , which promotes racial justice through trainings and conferences "" Everyone goes through this when they're sitting at the dinner table with family and friends and you think you'll just let that comment go , because it's a social gathering , "" says Briddell "" For me it was a defining moment I will never again not speak up I could have told him it was offensive I could have asked questions about why he was making those comments But I didn't . In recent years , there have been calls for a national dialogue about race and racism , prompted by everything from police-involved shootings of African Americans to the lack of diversity in Oscar nominations to Beyonce's Super Bowl half-time show and her song , Formation But often , those conversations in day-to-day life can be awkward and uncomfortable Rinku Sen , president and executive director of Race Forward : The Center for Racial Justice Innovation and publisher of news site Colorlines , says that sometimes the best way to begin a conversation about race is by asking lots of questions A few years ago , Sen was waiting in line at the Sundance Film Festival to buy tickets Sen , who is Indian-American , began chatting with a white woman behind her The woman told her she had adopted two African-American sons Sen told her she did racial justice work The woman told Sen that she had attended a two - or three-day race workshop and felt like she was hated by all the people of color there "" If I hear ' white privilege ' one more time , I'm going to hurt someone , "" the woman told Sen . For Sen , whose career is devoted to openly talking about white privilege – the notion that white people have inherent advantages in American society – the response was offensive "" There were many , many times I wanted to roll my eyes during that conversation , "" Sen says "" But the interesting thing I noted as we wound our way closer to the front … is that she'd say something not so great and , then , if I asked her a question , she'd talk her way in my direction , philosophically speaking At one point , she said she felt that white people see themselves as individuals , and blacks and Latinos see themselves in groups I said , ' you know why that is , don't you ? ' And she said ' because we get to live as individuals , whereas they are always lumped in with their group . ' For people of color who may be offended or angered by another's remarks , Sen's advice is to "" lower the litmus test Expect people to be less than perfect People are going to say the wrong things ""They're going to be imperfect ""They're not going to know a piece of history that's critical to your family . Even if someone ultimately says the wrong thing , the fact they are willing to engage in conversation is important , she said Derald Wing Sue , a professor of education and psychology at Columbia University's Teachers College and author of the book Race Talk and the Conspiracy of Silence : Understanding and Facilitating Difficult Dialogues on Race , says even when conversations take a turn for the worse , he tries to keep dialogue open Sue , who is Asian American , recalled an interaction with a white female student in his class who interrupted him while he was talking about race The woman challenged Sue , pointing out that women are oppressed , too She was uncomfortable and resistant , almost as if she felt like Sue was accusing white students of racism , he said "" When these interactions happen , I will generally agree , "" Sue said "" Women are also a marginalized group in our society But then I made a process observation I told her , ' you're right about that , but you seem so upset and angry Where is that coming from ? ' "" Eventually we got to the point that she understood what racism was about because as a woman , she had experienced the same things as well , "" Sue says "" When we get to the point we can talk about what buttons we are pushing , then we can really hear one another . Rev William Barber , president of the North Carolina state chapter of the NAACP and author of The Third Reconstruction , says sometimes the most productive conversations about race don't focus on skin color , but the broader class divisions and societal problems – issues such as police brutality , access to healthcare and childcare , voting rights and economic inequality ""Barber's work promoting interracial dialogue within North Carolina communities has led to the creation of seven local chapters of National Association for the Advancement of Colored People that are predominantly white – and a recognition by some in those communities that Barber is representing interests that cross racial lines "" When you deal with race from systemic perspectives and examine disparities , you can show how policies that disparately hurt black people end up hurting us all , "" he says For Briddell , one of the biggest bridge-builders is to tell personal stories so people can see how their upbringings and lives are shaped differently by race Briddell had a conversation recently with a white co-worker who talked about his experience going to Ocean City in New Jersey as a child Briddell , whose family lives in the area , told him about her dad , an African-American who could not visit Ocean City The only African-Americans who went to Ocean City in the 1940 ' s and 1950 ' s were gardeners , housekeepers or kitchen workers "" My coworker told me how much he appreciated my personal experience , because it made him think about how our lives were shaped differently because of racism , "" she says "" He said ' there are places I have been going to all my life and never thought about this . ' So how do you have a conversation about race Barber , Briddell , Sen and Sue provided these tips : Ask questions rather than make assertions , so you can understand why someone holds certain beliefs or opinions Tell personal stories about your life experiences and listen to how they differ from others ""Don't be colorblind Acknowledge racial and ethnic difference Temper your reaction if someone says something that offends you , but try to acknowledge the impact of their words as quickly as possible Take a break from the conversation if necessary and walk around the block You can't calmly respond if you are too filled with emotion to articulate why Take a deep breath and don't freeze when conversations turn awkward or uncomfortable Talk about policies and larger system-wide issues that may disproportionately affect people of color but have a wider impact on the entire community Take a chance even if it makes you uncomfortable If you make a mistake , you'll get the chance to have another conversation Just a willingness to begin the discussion is an important step For people of color , lower the litmus test People are going to make mistakes and they are going to say the wrong thing Expect people to be less than perfect , but remain engaged in the conversation Focus on the impact of people's words and not the intentions behind them People say racist things with intention and without intention Educate yourself There are thoughtful analyses and stories available for everyone to read Any opportunity is a good opportunity to talk about race , not just tragedies Big national stories often spark conversation but there is a version of that big national story probably going on near you "

It doesn't help that the opportunity for a higher education is tilted against black students , data show In Iowa , black students are less likely to graduate from high school and pursue higher education than whites While more than 92 percent of Iowa's white students graduated high school on time in 2014 , the figure was 77 percent for black students , according to the most recent data in the state's Annual Condition of Education Report Among those graduating seniors , 82 percent of white students planned to pursue higher education or training , compared with 75 percent of black students That contributes to low black enrollment at Iowa's public universities In 2015 , the University of Iowa , Iowa State University and UNI had 2,256 black students among them — making up less than 3 percent of the 80,000 students enrolled at all three schools Once in college , the odds of staying in school and graduating are stacked against blacks as well Over the past five years , they've been less likely than whites to return for their sophomore year and less likely to graduate from the state's public universities At Iowa State , for example , 75 percent of black students returned for their sophomore year in fiscal year 2015 , compared with 88 percent of white freshmen And while about 70 percent of white students graduate from the University of Iowa within six years , that number drops to less than 50 percent for black students , Board of Regents data show That gap is similar at ISU and UNI Students point to a multitude of slights and outright racism that they say have inhibited their success by fostering an unwelcoming college environment Some have been called racial slurs Others say campus authority figures have given preferential treatment to whites Most commonly , though , black students say they weather a constant barrage of racially tinged insults , some of them unintentional but no less hurtful That includes incidents on campus where white students , occasionally without an invitation , will reach out to touch black women's hair While such issues have brewed for years , if not generations , students say their complaints are receiving more attention this academic year in the wake of protests at the University of Missouri Members of the football team there threatened to boycott games until the university system's president stepped down He did , two days later , along with the chancellor of the Columbia , Mo . , campus ""Missouri's demonstrations , protests and even a hunger strike proved to students that they could force administrators to address festering racial issues , including those at Iowa universities , students , faculty and administrators at those institutions said "" Drake could easily become Mizzou , "" Drake University senior Jacqui Branch said "" Maybe not as intense , but I think that we're definitely dealing with the same sort of issues . ""America's colleges and universities , including in Iowa , have pushed to diversify their student bodies , and they now enroll more African-American students than ever , according to the National Center for Education Statistics But for younger generations of students , expectations have changed , Kington said When he attended college three decades ago , Kington , who is black , said he expected to encounter issues because of his race "" There's less willingness to accept the array of problems as just inevitable , "" he said "" And I think the students deserve credit for saying , ' Yes , we've achieved progress , but there are real problems here . ' At UNI , those problems coalesced into student protests , followed by months of debate and discussion that have laid bare just how disenfranchised many black students feel Ethnic Student Promoters , a volunteer recruiting group of multicultural students , boycotted a recruitment day last fall that was specifically targeted at bringing in minority students Students in the group said they were excluded from other recruiting opportunities and were trotted in only at opportune times to help the college's goal of recruiting minorities "" We feel like if they're not giving us equal opportunity , what is the point of them in using us on that day to say , ' Look , there are all these multicultural students here , ' "" said Julia Gand , a senior from Iowa City Gand , who is majoring in social work , transferred in as a junior and said she immediately felt that the racial climate was hostile "" If I had started here freshman year , I would have transferred somewhere else , "" she said In 2014 , a round of anonymous messages on social media , many stamped with "" #KeepUNIWhite2014 , "" stirred the UNI campus But most incidents are less blatant , students say They call them microaggressions , slights that make minority students feel isolated and set apart "" They're little paper cuts , "" said UNI adviser Colice Sanders , who is black "" But when it's happening on a daily basis , especially by faculty or people of power , it really adds up . During a November forum , Provost Jim Wohlpart acknowledged the problems and said the "" system "" had failed minority students He promised more than cosmetic change Now , UNI is looking through its curriculum , reviewing its student housing department and hiring new leaders to focus on diversity Similar reviews and conversations are ongoing at Iowa State and the University of Iowa , as well as at private colleges across Iowa "" This is not about repainting the wall a new color , "" Wohlpart said "" This is about knocking down the walls of the house and building a new house together . Tellis , the UNI freshman , was ready to leave Cedar Falls at the semester break But she resolved to stay , though she still largely distrusts the administration University officials acknowledged that her situation took too long to resolve When reached by the Register , her first roommate confirmed the story of their run-in , though she said she never intended her comments about the dance routine to be offensive and thought Tellis overreacted After Tellis ' incident with the second roommate , she found a vacancy in another room , sorting out the paperwork for a move herself "" I see it as I solved my own problem , "" she said Officials started reaching out to her and apologizing only after she had gone public with her story , she said More broadly , Tellis said university leaders just don't comprehend what it's like to be black at such a predominantly white university "" They've never been in this situation , and they'll never have to be in this situation , "" she said , "" so they don't understand where we're coming from or how to make us feel more comfortable being here .

December 2014 : A visiting University of Iowa art professor displays a Ku Klux Klan figure on the UI Pentacrest , in the same spot where hundreds of protesters had gathered the night before UI officials had not authorized display of the sculpture The artist says the sculpture was meant to highlight ongoing racial violence in the U . S . , but many members of the UI community saw the sculpture itself as a threat The incident sparks campuswide debates over the conflicts between the university's commitment to academic freedom and its responsibility to ensure a safe and welcoming campus for all its students . \u200b September 2015 : Iowa State University students say they were subjected to racist and bigoted remarks as they silently protested Republican Donald Trump's campaign appearance at a Cy-Hawk tailgate A forum that same month draws hundreds of students who expressed their dismay at racism they saw October 2015 : University of Iowa Student Government issues a statement condemning a series of comments , posted by UI students on several social media platforms , targeted against international Asian , Asian-American and Pacific Islander students October 2015 : Members of the University of Northern Iowa's Ethnic Student Promoters group boycott a multicultural recruitment day , saying they won't help administrators recruit students of color until the school's racial climate is addressed November 2015 : University of Iowa Police investigate racist graffiti discovered on a bathroom door in Spence Laboratories Police don't release the exact language used but say they are investigating the incident as a possible hate crime Largely in response to events at the University of Missouri , diversity officials at the University of Iowa held three listening posts in November in which dozens of black students shared their experiences and concerns about life on the predominantly white campus Nadine Petty , director of UI's Center for Diversity and Enrichment , said feedback from students showed that the university needs to do a better job of communicating with students about what is happening with any complaints they have lodged concerning a fellow student or instructor The students also raised concerns about lower retention and graduation rates for black students than nonminority students at all three of Iowa's public universities Other recurring themes among the participating students , according to the UI Chief Diversity Office , included : Discrimination experienced at local bookstores and other retail venues ; A feeling among black graduate and professional students of being siloed ; The lack of consequences for the use of hate language ; The need to arm faculty to know the difference between free speech and hate speech ; Challenges in residence halls ; Microaggressions in class and public discourse ; The constant centering of whiteness ; Calls for action and not just conversation about equity ; The need for more black faculty ; The poor physical condition of UI's Afro American Cultural Center ; The lack of focus on providing black students with survival strategies at a predominantly white institution ; The need to educate fraternity and sorority life organizations "
1,"A Trump administration could be like the end of Reconstruction Donald Trump's working class white supporters are always described as "" angry . They are certainly angry about economic decline , but there is more to it than that They are also angry about racial self-abasement The Obama administration has repeatedly humiliated whites for being white and ensured that there can be no defense against degradation This humiliation far exceeds the garden-variety racial humiliation of having to deal with incompetent affirmative-action co-workers or conversation-killing PC speech codes Donald Trump is like the post-Civil War Southern political leaders who sought to restore the honor of whites after bayonet-backed Radical Republican carpetbaggers imposed rule by former slaves The defenders of white honor were called "" Redeemers "" and , in a sense , Mr . Trump is a modern day Redeemer , even if he has not explicitly embraced this role Conquerors can treat the vanquished in many different ways : exterminate everyone , keep the women and kill the men and children , impose heavy tax burdens , or simply humiliate them When Europeans ruled China in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , humiliation took many forms In Shanghai , Chinese were banned from public parks unless accompanied by a Westerner – who could even be an infant Such petty degradations – and they occurred daily – stung deeply , and were seldom forgotten when the tables were turned A public humiliation is like the authorities proclaiming that 2 + 2 = 5 , and punishing anyone who denies this "" truth . The final blow is to force the humiliated openly to affirm that 2 + 2 = 5 This resembles the Soviet show trials of the 1930s : innocent Old Bolsheviks publicly degrading themselves by confessing to bogus crimes , and signing confessions to save their families President Obama has imposed race-related humiliation in several forms The most obvious might be called government-mandated guilt reversal : A criminal black is now defined as the "" good guy "" while the white cop becomes the "" bad guy . Evidence is irrelevant ; virtue or evil is dictated exclusively by skin color Recall Groucho Marx's quip : "" Who are you going to believe Me ( i . e . , President Obama or Eric Holder ) or your lying eyes ? By official decree , Trayvon Martin , Michael Brown , Eric Garner and Freddy Gray – all certified criminals – were deemed victims worthy of public sympathy while whites doing their duty , even risking their lives , were the evil-doers And just to rub it in , the riots generated by this good  evil reversal where treated by the mass media as "" understandable , "" because American race relations still have a long way to go , and government must "" invest "" yet more billions in futile programs to cure the scars of inequality , discrimination , racism , and all the other flaws of white society The prudent measures the police took in the face of turmoil were often criticized as excessively militarized , while young blacks looted and burned without any moral condemnation Sacking the CVS drug store in Baltimore was just "" sending a message . Only the bravest whites dared call the Black Lives Matters  "" Hands Up , Don't Shoot "" marchers rabble-rousing liars Humiliation escalated into collective guilt when Eric Holder's Justice Department sent investigators to Ferguson to determine why a white police officer would shoot a black teenager who had robbed a convenience store and then tried to kill the officer with his own gun There was never a chance the DOJ would investigate witness perjury or look into who instigated or even helped finance the riots Eric Holder had decreed that white officials were responsible for black misbehavior The solution was to recruit more black police officers , ease up on law enforcement , and silence any officer who defended himself There was more humiliation after Dylan Roof killed nine black church goers in Charleston , South Carolina The culprit quickly became all whites and their racist culture , not a single deranged individual In effect , the official narrative was that Southern whites are driven to violent hatred by the evil spirits still lurking in flags , statues , and the names on public building and parks These spirits had to be exorcised , since the mere sight of a stars-and-bars decal on a pickup truck might excite whites to mass murder Condemning whites without a trial , let alone evidence , has been a general policy under the Obama administration It is assumed that whites are bigoted and blacks are innocent , so any harm suffered by blacks can be due only to white malfeasance This belief is enshrined in the doctrine of disparate impact Thus , if schools punish black students at a higher rate than whites or Asians , discipline rates must be equalized via a consent decree Similarly , since there can be no racial differences in creditworthiness , any lending discrepancies can be due only to racism and must be "" healed "" by paying compensation to blacks , even if no case of actual discrimination can be documented In these cases the verdict is a foregone conclusion and no defense is permitted The DOJ consent decree is the equivalent of the Soviet-style show trial and signed confession Anyone who shows that blacks kill far more whites than vice versa or that blacks default on loans more often than whites only risks being called part of the problem Nor does it do much good to defend the behavior of white policemen by noting that the incident was thoroughly investigated and no grounds were found for indictment Any refusal to prosecute is just one more example of white privilege There are endless media accounts of black youngsters up to no good , all of whom were praised by mothers and friends as "" nice kids , "" all of whom were reportedly minding their own business , all of whom were about to turn their troubled lives around when they were attacked by racist police officers ""Washington's response to such incidents is another clich é : revamp "" flawed "" police practices , hire more minorities , etc . , without any evidence that these measures will either cure whites of "" racism "" or reduce black crime The cumulative psychological impact of this ongoing morality play is enormous Would a Trump administration end these race-based humiliations Most likely , though Mr . Trump would never publicly announce this policy reversal It is now an officially sanctioned "" truth "" that whites are responsible for the misbehavior of blacks ; this "" truth "" will not vanish even if the Donald appoints Chris Christie or someone like him as Attorney General But at least under President Trump , Americans need not worry that common criminals will be celebrated thanks to their skin color while white police officers are demonized for doing their jobs I believe that this unstated promise helps drives the passion for Donald Trump He is a modern day Redeemer "
1,"""School's president sets it on the path to Detroit Each day brings fresh reports of race-related craziness on American college campuses but if there were a contest for the most bizarre , the prize could would go to Yale It sets the gold standard with its presidential groveling and millions set aside to reward African-Americans for their uncivil behavior As Yogi Berra said , it's hard to make predictions , especially about the future , but having witnessed similar madness first hand for many decades , let me offer my clairvoyance This experiment will go though three stages : optimism , disappointment , and then – something currently unspeakable – part of Yale will come to resemble Detroit If this seems harsh , recall the transformation of countless American cities beginning in the mid - 1960s The noble experiment was officially begun by the President Peter Salovey announcing ( "" Toward A Better Yale "" ) "" that it is clear that we need to make significant changes so that all members of our community truly feel welcome . . and to reaffirm and reinforce our commitment to a campus where hatred and discrimination are never tolerated . He then followed with the usual boilerplate about Yale's commitment to full freedom of expression , but "" when universities and communities around the country are coming together to address longstanding inequalities , I believe that Yale can and should lead the way . Then comes the staggering list of goodies that will make Yale the inclusive City on a Hill The cornucopia begins with four new faculty positions to develop a "" transformative , multidisciplinary center . This to-be-created center will naturally have ample staff and resources It would be illegal to have racial quotas for filling these "" transformative "" positions , but "" Yale already has outstanding faculty members who are doing cutting-edge scholarship on the histories , lives , and cultures of unrepresented and under-represented communities "" who will supervise the hiring In short , it will be a racial payoff In the meantime , Yale will immediately add additional staff and undergraduate courses to address the concerns of the unrepresented and under-represented community and , for the next five years , will sponsor conferences on race , gender , inequality and inclusion Provost Ben Polak will oversee a $ 50 million university-wide program to enhance faculty diversity To guarantee results , a senior faculty member with the title of deputy dean for diversity will guide the initiative , and coordinate support and mentoring for untenured faculty The budgets for Yale's four cultural centers ( black , Indian , Hispanic , Asian ) will double and the centers will get "" faculty upgrades . If yet more money is needed , it will be forthcoming President Salovey further promises extra help for low-income students , and the offices that dole out money for financial emergencies will be expanded Meanwhile , the staff of Yale's Department of Mental Health and Counseling will receive multicultural training , and a renewed effort will be made to diversify its staff President Salovey himself , along with vice-presidents , deans , provosts and other members of the administration will be trained to recognize and combat racism and other forms of discrimination Department chairs , directors of graduate and undergraduate programs , and similar functionaries will get the same treatment There will be a greater commitment to spreading the word to undergraduates via Yale's orientation program , its speaker series , and other ongoing programs A committee of students , faculty , and staff will "" work together better to create an inclusive community , a community in which they all belong . Yale will also create a "" robust and clear "" mechanism for reporting , tracking , and stopping actions that violate the University's nondiscrimination policies Students will be taught the pathways for reporting discrimination , and mechanisms will be created to stamp it out To promote a more fair representation of the Yale community , the Committee on Public Art will ask for input on how diversity ( also known as "" vibrancy "" ) can be better celebrated on campus President Salovey offers as an example of this the "" Women's Table "" that has been set up in front of the Sterling Memorial Library So we can expect more portraits of blacks , Latino  as and members of the LGBT community Finally , Yale will take suggestions on names for two new residential colleges ( dormitories ) while Calhoun College – named after John C . Calhoun , a champion of the antebellum South and slave-owner – will have its name reviewed by the Yale Corporation The costs of this inclusionary project are enormous and I doubt if anybody has calculated the price of this tax on whites But less obvious will be the opportunity costs – the yet more thousands of hours that will now be allocated to alleviating the psychic distress of a handful of black undergraduates White ( and Asian ) job applications will be put on hold as Yale rushes to find qualified blacks , but the show must go on The euphoria inspired by President Salovey's total surrender will be brief Self-esteem , self-congratulations from speaking truth to power will evaporate in a few months Baloney about transformation will not bring academic improvement Renaming a building does not boost the intelligence of its residents Youngsters who struggled with organic chemistry before the Great Upheaval will still struggle , though , to be sure , the newly terrified chemistry professor will not dare flunk them It may now be even more difficult for blacks to master hard subjects after the thrill of school-as-radical-theater is gone They may get gift "" Bs "" in organic chemistry just for showing up , but the day of reckoning will come when they fail the MCAT and can't get into medical school SJW skills cannot be transferred to academic accomplishment ; the very opposite is true Whoever heard of a demonstration scheduled to begin at 8: 00 a . m . where participants had to answer tough questions and offer documentation No protestor is ever asked to explain why black professors are better able to teach black students To compound these bad habits , instructors will be afraid to turn down frivolous requests from black students to extend the deadline on a paper , reschedule an exam , or rewrite a terrible paper Professors will also be terrified of accusing students of cheating Waging a show-up-and-whine war to extract benefits breeds habits of sloth Nor will the perceived discriminations vanish After all , it was hyper-sensitivity that cowed Yale functionaries – a lesson not easily un-learned Endless talk of race will only provide more opportunities for microaggression The dictionary of racial code words will expand to six hefty volumes Thin skin will grow even thinner while the definition of "" hate "" becomes yet more elastic Black students will be outraged when the dean of inclusion , diversity , and outreach lets it slip out that recruiting qualified blacks isn't easy "" Are you suggesting that there's a shortage of smart blacks Off with his head ! If today's blacks want a campus 100 percent free of racial animosity , build a time machine and travel back to the 1950s when – as I well recall – nothing on those campuses that admitted blacks made them uncomfortable and they were happy to be there President Salovey's effort to cleanse the campus of hate and racism will energize blacks to invent new forms of oppression Creative agitators will discover that the lecture format is racist because it "" privileges "" a ( white ) instructor while forcing all students to sit still , not gossip on cell phones , and otherwise "" act white . Similarly , requiring research papers to be written in Standard English disadvantages those whose parents lacked the resources to impart elitist standards ""Tomorrow's demand will be that Yale hire black "" professor aids "" who will read the papers written by people of color and even write culturally sensitive exams , particularly in the hard sciences where blacks perform poorly due to cultural bias There will be demands for race-normed grades And with millions of dollars in play , there will be squabbles Black women will denounce black men for hogging leadership positions and otherwise behaving badly What about sharing the loot with other groups such as the LGBT contingent , Hispanics , the disabled , and everybody else who can make a claim to victimhood Only so many cultural centers can be established , and only so many portraits can be hung Academic work will now give way to fighting over the greatly expanded diversity pie The life of the mind , at least in humanities and social sciences , will become a nightmare A once lively campus will , at least in some fields , become an intellectual desert Professors , especially those lacking tenure , will cleanse their lectures and reading assignments of anything that might upset blacks Thanks to Yale's commitment to helping students snitch on professors who violate the school's commitment to diversity , inclusion , and non-discrimination , the campus will resemble the network of informers in East Germany – a Stasi of color Better not say "" slave ; "" the correct term is "" enslaved person . This inquisition rests entirely on perceptions and feelings ; it is irrelevant if the offense is factually correct or expressed to stimulate discussion There can be no defense against the crime of having given offense Intellectual and social life will grow increasingly segregated – a Darwinian speciation Professors will shun black students , given that any interaction with them is walking on eggshells Not even private e-mail or Facebook postings will be safe The Yale campus will then experience its own version of white flight along with the corresponding changes that this exodus created in cities Thanks to President Salovey's New World Order , faculty who can flee Yale – those approaching retirement , academic stars always in demand at other schools , those enjoying options in industry or government – will jump ship Meanwhile , top white students will enroll elsewhere Among those who attend Yale , youngsters enjoying rough and tumble discussions will move off campus and form clubs with cryptic names that disguise the sin of exclusion Undergraduate literature lovers who disdain third-rate female black authors will set up a dinner and drinking club at a suburban motel and invite professors to safe houses whose location will be changed each week Soviet-style repression invites Soviet-style resistance White flight will be reflected in empty seats in countless classes Few whites will enroll in courses taught by black ideologues Students must , of course , take some classes but why bother showing up to hear anxious instructors rehash material from a textbook with the PC imprimatur White ( and Asian ) Yalies will avoid on-campus socializing lest they risk being overhead laughing inappropriately At Halloween parties at secret locations students will dress up as the Dean of Diversity to terrify professors As in the old Soviet Empire , rituals will develop to test whether friends are trustworthy But the biggest shift toward a Detroit-like atmosphere will come from the combination of recruiting marginal black students and implementing the "" safe spaces "" policy Increasing black enrollment means signing up even more doubtful candidates They will need endless tutoring but , on the plus side , they are "" authentic "" by the standard of contemporary blackness Many could be members of a new affirmative-action category : children of incarcerated parents And what will happen when this contingent reaches critical mass and realizes that thanks to the doctrine of "" safe space "" they enjoy legal extraterritoriality They will no longer be stopped by the now culturally competent police for loitering , dealing drugs , disorderly conduct , public intoxication , or shoplifting What is worse , non-Yale blacks will discover that the black-themed cultural centers and residential houses are de facto black sanctuaries Why hang out in dreary New Haven housing projects when you can "" attend "" Yale and enjoy free Ivy League amenities without being bothered by racist police or having to attend class These outsiders could become part of the black on-campus community An Ivy League campus with thousands of rich , naïve youngsters and shops catering to this clientele is a target rich environment : so many drunken frat boys , so many gullible white coeds and so many luxury stores Campus security will be virtually powerless to stop prowlers since this would be the unforgivable sin of racial profiling and even stereotyping An officer who questioned "" suspicious "" blacks at 3:00 a . m . a few feet from a residence hall full of white coeds would be immediately shipped out for enhanced sensitivity training This scenario is hardly hypothetical During the 1960s , ' 70s and ' 80s , many universities in places such as New York City were hit by crime waves and struggled financially when families were reluctant to send their children to live among muggers and drug dealers Yale is Yale , but in the long run no school can survive if students are routinely victimized Parents who pay upward of $ 60,000 a year in tuition and fees are not easily convinced that crime is a small price to be paid for diversity and inclusion Since the spineless administrators dare not eliminate the crime-infested "" safe spaces , "" they will spend yet more money insulating students More police will be hired , not to arrest thieves and rapists , but to provide escorts to Yalies There will be security cameras and police call boxes everywhere Free , Yale-supplied transportation will carry students the three or four blocks to class Orientation will include lectures on personal safety and what to do when asked for your wallet , though , of course , students will be warned about "" stereotypes . Self-defense classes will become popular even as the university does its best to push black-on-white crime out of the newspapers A few students may even start shooting clubs The campus and its surroundings will resemble a commuter school where students drive in , attend class , and then leave Old-timers returning for reunions will be advised to be on the lookout for some ill-defined "" trouble . Bars and restaurants will suffer since few Yalies will risk walking home intoxicated Many businesses will fold and "" for rent "" signs will be pop up Wig shops , Seven-Elevens selling lottery tickets , pay-day loan sharks , and check-cashing stores will replace the older WASPY haunts But this will be an environment in which black students can truly feel at home "
1,"Why I changed and what it means for me My heart raced at the sight of the long sticks the three angry men were brandishing I futilely asked my mother what was going on , as our party inside the car spoke in panicked Yoruba with the group outside It was my first visit to Nigeria My mother , uncle , grandmother and I were driving to a village hours away from Lagos when three men stepped into the middle of the road We had to screech to a halt to avoid hitting them To this day , I don't know what those men wanted , but given that , according to the UN's 2010 figures , 61 percent of the population lives on less than a dollar a day , I'd bet they wanted money – or the car From the moment I set foot in Nigeria , it was easy to see why my parents had left My mother and I had to pay bribes to pass safely through the airport Beggars walked around outside the airport asking travelers for money It was not uncommon to see people squatting on the side of the road defecating The gash on my uncle's head corroborated his story about being robbed and pistol whipped A billboard in Lagos read in pigeon English , "" AIDS No dey show da face . ( Translation : You can't tell a person has AIDS by looking at them . I was born in 1990 in the United States , about a year after my parents arrived They brought with them a couple of suitcases , my older brother , and big dreams for the future In less than 25 years , they have managed to establish a medical practice and build a home for their six-person family Their hard work knows no limits , but their tolerance and understanding do They cannot comprehend how their first-generation American daughter became a race realist My views are no different from the average AR reader I accept that the cause of the one-standard-deviation difference in the average IQ scores of blacks and whites is primarily genetic I am convinced that blacks tend to have different dispositions from whites and East Asians – also for genetic reasons And most importantly , I believe that all people have the right to associate with whomever they please , and that given this option most will choose their own race I did not come to these conclusions overnight Initially , I believed what I was taught by my parents and teachers : Sub-Saharan Africa is poor because of centuries of exploitation , and black Americans lag behind white Americans because of slavery and segregation My belief in the egalitarian vision was based on a reluctance to accept that I am of inferior stock In high school , I knew very little about Richard Hernstein and Charles Murray's The Bell Curve , but when a teacher said the book was biased , I accepted that assertion without questioning it I was relieved to learn of the existence of culture-fair IQ tests , such as the Black Intelligence Test of Cultural Homogeneity , that show blacks are as smart as whites Of course , I never bothered to research the BITCH It was enough for me that there were educated people who thought it was valid and reliable The discovery that a book that argued that environment explains European hegemony and African failure was highly rated on Amazon also helped me hold onto my bias I never opened Guns , Germs and Steel by Jared Diamond , but as long as there were educated people who accepted his theories , I didn't question them During my freshman year at the University of Georgia , I found a blog called Racialicious Reading articles about "" micro-aggressions "" and "" red-lining "" further convinced me that blacks were victims of an "" injustice system . My views were becoming more and more radical and my tolerance for dissent was waning My college was predominantly white , and I got into more than my share of arguments about whether organizations for minorities should exist and whether it was significant that a black man was elected president At a dining hall one night , my Gujarati Indian friend's white boyfriend angrily asked where white organizations could hold their meetings I argued that UGA was trying to foster an environment that welcomes people of all racial and ethnic backgrounds I added that not all students were Southern whites , and that those who weren't should be allowed to organize to address their unique needs I asked him what concerns white students could possibly have at a college that is 73 percent white To my annoyance , my friend came to his aid , saying that recognizing non-white students was discrimination against whites I was shocked and angry that a "" person of color "" would say that I even condemned her as a sell-out to another Indian friend who shared my views Now I am impressed that my friend thinks for herself rather than sticking to the unofficial Person of Color doctrine The issue of whether non-whites should have their own organizations at universities is probably the only racial issue in which my opinion has not changed since becoming a race realist – however , I believe whites should have the same rights The night Barack Obama was first elected president , a white Republican friend and I exchanged messages on Facebook He didn't think it mattered that a black man had made it to our nation's highest office I was appalled at his insistence that "" race didn't matter . For centuries , only white men had access to the White House and now that has changed , I told him I still think that the election of Barack Obama means racism no longer presents a powerful barrier to the ambitions of blacks , but given the anti-white agenda of the Obama administration , I silently hope that whites never again elect a black president Fortunately , my days as a racial egalitarian were short lived First , I discovered a book called Losing the Race : Self-Sabotage in Black America , written by a black man named John McWhorter Dr . McWhorter debunked many of the claims that had radicalized me Slowly , my eyes started to open Was it possible that "" white racism "" was largely a figment of the collective black imagination Then came Larry Elder , another open-minded black man His book , The Ten Things You Can't Say In America , showed me that there is no such thing as "" red-lining "" and that blacks tend to be more racist than whites In just a short time , I had gone from believing that blacks were oppressed to believing that blacks had the power to lift themselves up Prof . Michael Levin of City University helped me make the final leap from egalitarian to race realist At the beginning of Why Race Matters , he asks why anyone would think that blacks are as smart as whites Stereotypes of blacks have been consistent throughout history , and black academic performance has always been lower than that of whites I thought of my oil-rich home country Despite billions of dollars in natural resources , Nigeria remains mired in corruption , crime , violence , disease , and poverty , not unlike the rest of sub-Saharan Africa I remembered my fruitless attempts in high school to find records of pre-colonization African inventions One of my uncles dismissed my claim that Africans never invented anything by saying that Europeans destroyed many African civilizations and re-wrote history Before reading Prof . Levin , I believed him Since becoming a race realist , I have spent countless hours trying to explain to some of my egalitarian friends that blacks did not evolve high intelligence because the warm African environment did not require it A white former friend who holds an anthropology degree from my college de-friended me on Facebook , insisting that race is not even biological A white former friend insisted that as a public school teacher she has had similar failure rates across racial lines Years later , on Facebook , she likened Donald Trump to Hitler and Stalin , and asked that all Trump supporters de-friend her immediately I debated a cousin who did not call me names and was actually open-minded enough to read the articles I sent him The fact that he also sent me a woman's attempt to refute Dr . Levin's arguments gives me hope that he may someday become a race realist himself Thus far , I have painted a negative picture of the life of a black race realist , but the truth is that a huge sigh of relief escaped my lips upon learning that blacks are intellectually disadvantaged There is no global conspiracy to keep us down If I work hard and abide by the law , I will succeed Sadly , my view of the world is not shared by my family , who watched television in horror during the coverage of the shootings of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown To this day , my mother insists that George Zimmerman should have been convicted because he pursued Trayvon Martin with a gun despite orders not to She has turned a blind eye to Mr . Zimmerman's injuries and the evidence that he fired in self defense after being attacked My father and brothers still believe that the police are waging war on young black men My younger brother attended a rally at his college to honor Michael Brown's memory My mother encourages me not to talk about politics or race in public because people will be horrified She agrees with my dad that I was brainwashed against blacks because I attended a mostly white college in a red state My dad believes that experiencing racism at the hands of whites will cure me I disagree If I ever come face to face with malicious whites , I am confident that it won't turn me into an "" anti-racist . I doubt that even racially conscious whites would be unkind to me My experiences with race realists have been positive so far One kind Jewish blogger interviewed me and later we talked via Skype He is a fascinating person and didn't seem to have an ounce of hostility towards me Another white race realist and I have become good enough friends that we Skype at least every month I have met a few black race realists online as well One lives in Nigeria and bravely chooses not to relocate to the West We regularly post statuses on Facebook about what's happening to whites worldwide The other lives in Canada but prefers to keep his race realist views secret He dates white women and wants to marry one Even after I talked to him about regression to the mean , he told me that given his high IQ and that of his parents , he doesn't think he would be dragging down a wife's children intellectually I have tried fruitlessly to convince my white girl friends to avoid black men without sounding like I am motivated by jealousy One dates black men almost exclusively and suffers as a result She has had black men vandalize her car and cheat on her , but last I checked she was pursuing yet another black man whom she insists is different from the others I continue to hope that she won't end up like a never-married white , female co-worker who has two mulatto kids from two different black men , neither of whom pay child support or act as a father I have tried hard to figure out why some white women behave this way My theories run from social acceptance to low intelligence Some AR readers insist that if white men had not defected from ethno-nationalism , there would be no mulattoes being born to white women These men have convinced me that women are not hard-wired to be leaders , and that it is up to white men to lead the West out of its malaise I have had no success in trying to understand why white men believe in liberal creationism , but whatever the cause , it has yet to infect Eastern Europeans They are very ethno-nationalist and traditional , and may be the best hope for the white race Whites should discriminate in favor of their own race in foreign aid Instead of sending money to sub-Saharan Africa , white-sponsored charities could help Eastern Europeans who suffer from alcoholism , AIDS , and prostitution White churches could help Afrikaner refugees leave South Africa In Mark Twain's time , well-off whites took in poorer whites and educated them Why has that changed My political activism is not limited to white nationalism I am a vegan and a supporter of environmentalism and animal welfare Studying the tactics used by the other organizations I support has given me an idea about how I could help Within the next few years , I plan to start giving scholarships to college students who learn about what's happening to whites worldwide I don't mind giving away some of my income for this cause It is only because of whites that I live far away from the daily dangers of armed robbery , rape , and kidnapping in Nigeria If race deniers are not stopped , soon I won't have to travel to Nigeria to be put in a near car-jacking situation again The three men who stopped our car in Nigeria asked who owned the car My mom and uncle told them that my grandmother was the owner As luck would have it , the men recognized their dialect of Yoruba , and determined we were all from the same part of Nigeria They let us pass unharmed Incidents like these will happen more often as the West continues to embrace non-whites It is my sincere hope that as the number of race realists grows , we can bring back segregation and whites can build a homeland for their children This takes precedence over all my other political views Animal welfare and environmentalism can wait In the words of Charles Lindbergh , "" It is the European race we must preserve ; political progress will follow .

1,"All Praise is due to Allah Alone , The All - Mighty , All-Wise … And may His Peace and Blessings be upon Prophet Muhammad , his family , companions and all those who follow him till the Day of Judgment … There used to be a time when the truth was difficult to distinguish from falsehood and the friends of Allah were difficult to distinguish from the friends of shaytan ( May Allah curse him ) However , the two camps are rapidly being separated This Ummah , in Egypt and Bangladesh has had thousands of its sons massacred They were killed due to their demanding that the Law of Allah be implemented on the land of Allah And who were the killers They were people who spoke the same tongues and had the same skins as those they slaughtered ; but their hearts had been depleted of Iman After being denied the opportunity to try and establish this Deen through democracy , they went to the streets in protest Although protesting is one's right in democracy , this right is not available to those who demand the Shariah of Allah Freedom from tyranny and man-made law cannot come through peaceful protests This was a lesson sadly learnt in Syria ; after tens of thousands lost their lives , the people realised that the only way to defeat these oppressive regimes is to answer their bullets with bullets and their bombs with bombs Oh our dear Muslim Ummah The Crusader-Zionists have been working day and night since the last few centuries to demolish Islam , as it was revealed to Prophet Muhammad They seek to befool us that Islam can be stitched together with their Secular , Democratic "" New World Order "" and the "" Constitutional "" system which was only designed to serve their interests Beware The religion of Allah cannot be stitched together with any man-made religion , philosophy or ideology Islam came down to rule , and it cannot be ruled over Therefore , we call you to carefully understand the call of the Mujahideen and the righteous scholars Understand the word of Tawheed – upon which the balance of the entire universe so delicately stands Understand the heinous crime of those who forsake the Hakimiyyah of Allah and implement laws on earth that do not have any authority from Allah We are free from this "" New World Order "" , its bogus "" Charters "" , its "" Democracy "" and its putrid "" Constitutions "" We believe in Allah Alone – and His Shariah , His Legislation Alone ; there is absolutely no compromise on this issue The governments and armies of our lands are in place only to suppress the true call of Islam , and they receive their orders from the greatest criminal nation in history , America , and its Crusader-Zionist allies The only way these criminals will be removed from power and the Law of Allah established on earth is through Jihad fee Sabeelillah against America who is behind all of the Tawagheet who have usurped power in our lands , then against their stooges in the Muslim world If we carry on this path with the Quran in one hand and the sword in the other , we believe , and we pray to Allah , that the time is near when we will see the end of these apostate regimes So , dear Ummah Follow the example of your Mujahid brothers in Afghanistan , Iraq , Syria , Somalia , Pakistan , Nigeria , Mali , Sinai , Yemen , North Africa and The Caucasus among others , who have sacrificed their lives for this noble cause And if the Shariah does not get implemented in our lives , and we die striving for it , even then we are successful Maulana Abdul Rasheed Ghazi ( May Allah have mercy on him ) who was martyred in Lal Masjid simply for calling to the Shariah of Allah , explained to us the reality of our struggle quite succinctly : "" The Divine revelations denote that the truth prevails under all circumstances It is not necessary for us to be around for the truth to prevail It is also quite possible that once we have departed from the world , this movement gains such strength that it succeeds in establishing the Islamic system I believe that if the Islamic system is established at the cost of our lives , it will not be an unprofitable bargain !

1,"All Praise is due to Allah Alone – and may His Peace and Blessings be upon Prophet Muhammad , his family , companions and all those who follow him till the Day of Judgment Following on from our series on the Life after Death , we now mention some of the details of the reward and punishment that the human soul will receive in the grave This is a reminder to both Muslims and Kuffar around the world to turn back to Allah , and concentrate on their real future – the eternal afterlife about which there is no doubt whatsoever We ask Allah to save us all from His Punishment The punishments of the grave are a reality and the Prophet has taught us to seek refuge from them It is narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet said , "" When any of you finishes the final Tashahhud , he should seek refuge with Allah from four things : from the punishment of Jahannam ( Hellfire ) , the punishment of the Grave , the trials of the living and the dead , and the trials of the Dajjal . [ Muslim ] Let us now take a brief look at some of the punishments of the grave – and these are according to the level of the sins of a person We seek Allah's refuge from them The Grave of the Kafir A bu Saeed Al-Khudhri t reports that the Messenger of Allah said , "" When the funeral is ready ( for its burial ) and the people lift it on their shoulders , then if the deceased is a righteous person he says , ' Take me ahead , ' and if he is not a righteous one then he says , ' Woe to it ( me ) Where are you taking it ( me ) ? ' And his voice is audible to everything except human beings ; and if they heard it , they would fall down unconscious "" [ Bukhari ] Bara bin ' Azib t reports that the Messenger of Allah said about the death of the Kafir : "" ... His spirit will be restored to his body ; two angels will come to him , make him sit up and ask him : ' Who is your Lord ? ' He will reply : ' Alas , alas I do not know . ' They will ask him : ' What is your religion ? ' He will reply : ' Alas , alas I do not know . ' They will ask : ' Who was the man who was sent on a mission among you ? ' He will reply : ' Alas , alas I do not know . ' Then a crier will call from Heaven : ' He has lied So spread a bed for him from Hell , clothe him from Hell , and open for him a door into Hell . ' Then some of its heat and pestilential wind will come to him , and his grave will be compressed , so that his ribs will be crushed together . [ Abu Dawud ] The torment of the Kafir , the apostate and the hypocrite starts immediately after death The ripping out of the soul , the desperate crying unheard by men , the humiliation of the angels ' insults , the spread of fire under him , the regret of seeing his place in Paradise if he had become a Muslim – all these are warnings to the Kuffar to listen to the message of The Quran and take heed of its words The position of Ahlus-Sunnah Wal Jama'ah with regards to the Muslim sinner is that he will ultimately enter Paradise because of his declaration of faith , La ilaha ill Allah Muhammad - ur-Rasoolullah However , he may receive punishment for his misdeeds in this life which do not reach the level of Kufr or Shirk Let us now look at some of the punishments in the Barzakh mentioned in the revealed texts regarding the Muslim sinner Most of these were mentioned in the Hadith of the Prophet's night journey and in a separate Hadith narrated by Imam Bukhari ( RA ) which mentioned a dream of the Prophet For the sake of brevity and understanding , the relevant parts of these Ahadith will be listed below : We seek Allah's refuge from His torment : The one who turned away from prayer "" ..Some people were cracking open their heads with a stone Every time they did this , their heads were restored to what they were like in the first place This went on and on without stopping I ( the Prophet e ) said , ' Jibril Who are they ? ' Jibril replied , ' They are people who turned away from the prayer ' ... "" The one who didn't pay Zakah "" ..They will be driven like cattle and forced to eat herbage more bitter than aloes and the bitter fruit of Zaqqum and driven on the hot stones of Hellfire because they did not purify their property with Zakah ... "
1,""" ... So we ( The Prophet and the angels ) proceeded and came across something like a Tannur I ( the narrator , Samura bin Jundub ) think the Prophet said , ' In that oven , there was much noise and voices . ' The Prophet added , ' We looked into it and found naked men and women , and behold , a flame of fire was reaching to them from underneath , and when it reached them , they cried loudly ' ... "" The angels later told the Prophet : "" ... And those naked men and women whom you saw in a construction resembling an oven , they are the adulterers and the adulteresses ... "" "" ... And so we ( The Prophet and the angels ) proceeded and came across a river . ' ( The narrator of the Hadith said ) ' I think he said , ' .... red like blood . ' ' The Prophet added , ' And behold , in the river there was a man swimming , and on the bank there was a man who had collected many stones Behold While the other man was swimming , he went near him The former opened his mouth and the latter ( on the bank ) threw a stone into his mouth whereupon he went swimming again He returned and every time the performance was repeated ... "" The angels later told the Prophet : "" ... and the man whom you saw swimming in the river and being given a stone to swallow , is the eater of usury ( Riba  interest ) . In another narration , it is said : "" They will have bellies as big as houses and whenever one of them gets up , he is knocked down and says , ' O Allah Do not let the hour come ! ' They are in the path of the people of Pharaoh who come and trample them while they can do nothing but scream These are people who devoured usury . "" ..So we ( The Prophet and the angels ) proceeded and came to a man lying flat on his back and another man standing over his head with an iron hook , and behold He would put the hook in one side of the man's mouth and tear off that side of his face to the back ( of the neck ) and similarly tear his nose from front to back and his eye from front to back Then he turned to the other side of the man's face and did just as he had done with the other side He hardly completed his side when the other side returned to its normal state Then he returned to it to repeat what he had done before ... "" "" ... As for the man you ( O Muhammad ) came upon , whose sides of mouth , nostrils and eyes were torn off from front to back , he is the symbol of the man who goes out of his house in the morning and tells so many lies that it spreads all over the world ... "" The Prophet said : "" ..I set out with them and we ( Prophet and the angels ) came across a man lying down , and behold Another man was standing over his head , holding a big rock Behold , he was throwing the rock at the man's head , injuring it The rock rolled away and the thrower followed it and took it back By the time he reached the man , his head returned to the normal state The thrower then did the same as he had done before ... "" The angels later told the Prophet that this man was "" the symbol of the one who studies the Quran , and then neither recites it , nor acts on its orders and sleeps , neglecting the enjoined prayers . "" ..They will cut pieces from their own sides and eat their own flesh They are the slanderers and those about whom the Prophet said : ' We saw people cutting flesh from their sides and eating it It was said , ' As you used to consume the flesh of your brother ! ' I asked , ' Who are they ? ' and I was told , ' Those of your community who slandered . ' ... "" ..They will have brass nails with which they will scratch their faces and chests They are those who were backbiters and maligned people's honor ... "" Ibn ' Abbas narrated that Allah's Prophet passed by two graves and said , "" Both of them ( persons in the grave ) are being tortured , and they are not being tortured for a major sin This one used not to save himself from being soiled with his urine , and the other used to go about with calumnies ( among the people to rouse hostilities , e . g . , one goes to a person and tells him that so-and-so says about him such-and-such evil things ) . The Prophet then asked for a green leaf of a date-palm tree , split it into two pieces and planted one on each grave and said , "" It is hoped that their punishment may be abated till those two pieces of the leaf get dried . [ Bukhari ] "" They will be screaming with their mouths gaping open while they devour hot coals which come out of their anuses These are people who consumed the property of the orphans . The life in the Barzakh is a life of bliss for the believer The righteous shall be in graves which are like "" gardens from the gardens of Paradise . The window of Paradise shall be open to them and they will sleep till the Day of Judgment like a bride All of this has preceded us in our article in the last issue of Azan Magazine Here , we will mention the status of the martyr who sacrifices his life for the sake of Allah In a Hadith , the Prophet mentioned the special status given to the martyr in the life of Barzakh : "" When your brothers were killed at Uhud , Allah had their souls in the insides of green birds flying on the banks of the rivers of Paradise and eating from the fruits thereof At night , these birds spend their evenings in lanterns hanging to the throne of Allah When the martyrs saw the blessings they were in , they said : ' Who would convey to our brothers that we are living in Paradise so they will not ignore Jihad and stop fighting . Allah then revealed : "" And never think of those who have been killed in the cause of Allah as dead Rather , they are alive with their Lord , receiving provision ; rejoicing in what Allah has bestowed on them of His bounty , and they receive good tidings about those after them who have not yet joined them - that there will be no fear concerning them , nor will they grieve They receive good tidings of favor from Allah and bounty and that Allah does not allow the reward of believers to be lost . [ 3:169- 171 ] [ Muslim , Abu Dawud ] So , the martyrs have a special life in the Barzakh – their souls are in the bodies of green birds flying through Paradise What a wonderful condition But the ' being in the bodies of green birds ' is not exclusive to the martyrs Shaykh Ashiq Ilahi ( RA ) writes : "" However , the souls of the martyrs are not the only ones to be embodied in green birds ; souls of other believers are also embodied in green birds and go about the heaven The Messenger of Allah said : ' Indeed , the souls of the believers lie in the green birds which eat from the tree of the Heaven . ' [ Mishkat ] Mulla Ali Qari ( RA ) writes in his commentary on this Hadith : ' One Hadith mentions that the souls of the believers are in the bodies of the birds , eating fruits from Paradise and drinking the water thereof , and resting in golden lamps under the throne . All believers who are given the gift of forgiveness by Allah will be saved from the torment of the grave This is because Allah said : "" Truly those who believe , and do deeds of righteousness , and perform As-Salah ( Iqamat-as - Salah ) , and give Zakah , they will have their reward with their Lord On them shall be no fear , nor shall they grieve . [ 2:277 ] And the Prophet said : "" By the One in whose Hands lies my life When the dead body is placed in the grave and people go back , he hears the sound of shoes Hence if he is a believer , his Salah ( prayers ) come to his head , his Saum fasts ) come to his right and Zakah to his left side , while Nafl ( voluntary prayers ) come from behind his legs If the torment advances from the head-side , his Salahs block the way ; when it advances from the right side , his Saum stops it ; when it comes from the left side , Zakah comes in the way And when it wants to intrude from the leg side , Nafl prayers stand in the way . [ At-Targheeb wal Tarheeb ] Abu Hurayrah reported Allah's Messenger as saying : "" When a man dies , his acts come to an end except three : recurring charity , knowledge ( by which people ) benefit , or a pious son who prays for him ( i . e for the deceased ) . [ Muslim ] Included in things that provide reward even after death are public welfare constructions like mosques , travel lodges , inns , canals etc Abu Hurayrah also reported that the Messenger of Allah said : "" Almighty Allah will elevate the status of Heavenly men in Paradise He will ask with wonder : ' O Allah How did I get such a high status ? ' Almighty Allah will say , ' It is because of seeking forgiveness by your chidren that you got such a high status . [ Mishkat ] ' Abdullah bin Abbas reports that once a Companion of the Messenger of Allah pitched a tent at a grave without any knowledge about it ( While sitting in the tent ) he found that a person was reciting Surah "" Tabarak alladhi biyadihil-mulk "" till he came to the end He reported this event to the Messenger of Allah Thereupon he said , "" This Surah prevents the punishment and it was saving him from the punishment of Allah . Khalid bin Madan ( A Tabi ' í ) says about Surah Mulk and Surah Sajdah that these two Surahs will fight for their reciter in the grave and will say , ' O Allah If we belong to your Book , accept our intercession in his favour In case we do not belong to your Book , get us obliterated These two will spread their wings like the birds and will save him from the torment of the grave . [ Mishkat ] "" The martyr receives six good things from Allah : He forgives him as soon as his blood is spilled and shows him his place in the Garden ; He Protects him from the punishment of the grave ; He gives him security from the Greatest Terror He places on his head a crown of dignity , a single ruby of which is more valuable than this world and all that it contains ; He marries him to 72 dark-eyed Hoors , and He intercedes for seventy of his relatives . [ Tirmidhi , Ibn Majah ] Abu Hurayrah narrated : The Messenger of Allah said : "" The martyr feels nothing from the agony of death except like one of you would feel from a sting of an insect . [ Tirmidhi , Nasai , Ibn Majah , Bayhaqi , Ahmad , Darimi ] Abu Ayyub reported that the Messenger of Allah said : "" One who faces the enemy and remains stable till he either gets martyrdom or makes him subdued , he will be saved from the torment of the grave . [ Nasai , Tabrani ] So , in the end , if someone comtemplates about how much detail Allah has gone into to explain the reality of the Hereafter , he will conclude that he needs to prepare for it We ask Allah to allow us to prepare for the Hereafter and save us from the torment of the grave , and indeed all other torments to follow ..In the next issue , we will In Sha Allah discuss the resurrection of the human soul for the eternal next life ... Peace be upon those who follow the Guidance .."
1,"On the ground , the Crusaders have experienced that the more soldiers they send towards the Muslim lands , the target range of Mujahideen expands , resulting in lot of casualties amongst their soldiers Also the difficulties and hardships of war make their soldiers psychiatric patients , this being a real war and not a Hollywood movie ..Therefore , militarily , the USA has resorted towards 2 main strategies : 1 ) Conducting Raids 2 ) Drone Attacks 1 ) Conducting Raids : Raiding has been a common tactic of the USA since the war started in 2001 The difference is that from 2001 till 2012 , they conducted raids on common Muslims wherever and whenever they wanted The Crusaders raided common Muslims households , arresting men who were not even Mujahideen They took away the daughters of this Ummah , violating their honor and buried them in the ground For this reason the Muslims in Afghanistan , especially in Kunar and Nuristan provinces , started to build hidden rooms in their homes in order to hide their women and children during American raids But now after losing the battle on the ground , they have been forced to roll back their camps from much of Afghanistan Recently they have only focused their raids on high priority targets like the raids that they recently conducted in Libya and Somalia The advantage they have in night-raids is that the Apache helicopters have night vision as do the American soldiers But as the Mujahideen guard themselves at night , it's not a big problem One Turkish brother gave me a first-hand account of an American night-raid on their camp in Afghanistan He had placed guarding duty in turns for every brother The brothers got alerted when the American helicopters came , so they immediately took positions The Americans descended carrying M - 16s with laser target pointers but these laser pointers played out positive for the Mujahideen and the Turkish brothers started shooting at the source of the lasers , eventually causing multiple casualties and forcing the enemy to retreat 2 ) Drone Attacks : As American soldiers are pampered cowards , it's very hard for them to survive in rough and tough places like Iraq and Afghanistan Truly they are not man enough to face the lions of Allah ; the apostate Governments in Muslim lands accommodate and cooperate with the CIA in carrying out these drone attacks W hat we have learned in Jihad is that whatever military equipment that they brought can always be countered by us through the Help of Allah This optimistic mentality and the consequent success has made the Mujahideen's psyche so strong that they will never surrender to anyone When they used Jammers to jam our Improvised Explosives Devices ( IED's ) , the Mujahideen , after seizing the American camps , confiscated those jammers and passed it to our electronic engineers who created anti-Jammers In the first issue of Azan Magazine I had discussed in detail about how drones operate in an article named "" The Drone Chain "" , and in the same article I asked for a response from my brothers of the blessed Ummah The response was overwhelming and it further cleared our understanding and enlarged our database regarding countering the unmanned aircraft Information is crucial in countering any technology The good news to the brothers is that we have closed the communication gap between us We are stepping towards the right direction and the more we'll cooperate , co-ordinate and communicate regarding this collective threat to the Ummah , In Sha Allah I hope we'll make these drones useless for the Crusaders We are an Ummah of 1.6 billion Muslims , with no shortage of mind , resources and most importantly men "" O you who believe If you help ( in the cause of ) Allah , He will help you , and make your foothold firm . [ 47:7 ] Below is a counter-drone strategy that we have devised : Join The Caravan of Homegrown Heroes Join the caravan of our brothers Nidal Hassan , Tamerlan and Dzhokhar among others This is the paramount action that you can take in helping the global Jihad , countering and taking revenge of drone strikes on Muslims , avenging what the USA and her allies have done in the Muslim lands and most importantly , this can be a giant step in freeing Palestine from the Jewish occupation These Crusaders say that they are killing Muslims in their regions so that the war doesn't come in their homeland ; that is why they want to fight this war away from home The brothers in the battlefield of Afghanistan and Iraq have given huge sacrifices but they can't go to New York to take revenge for what the Crusaders and Zionists did in Jerusalem , Fallujah and Kandahar We are looking towards our brothers in the West to act Destroy their peace , security , economy and lives as they destroy ours Brothers who are willing to attack in the West What we are focused on is to cause maximum damage to the enemy The experience that we have gained in the recent past is that the brothers who have the ability to train themselves and covertly act in their respective countries have a greater success rate than those planned from the theatres of Jihad and they carry a huge surprise factor Those who have carried out attacks like our brothers Nidal Hassan , Tamerlan and Johar never travelled to Yemen or Pakistan They never went through the strict airport and immigration checking They were the pious explosives in the midst of Kuffar , who exploded on time for the benefit of the whole Ummah The Kuffar have been trying their best to integrate the Muslims born in their lands into their kufr culture But Alhamdulillah not only have many Muslim youth realized the only way towards success in this life and the next is by worshipping Allah through the action of Jihad , many of their own children have converted to the true religion and are willing to sacrifice their lives for Allah , His religion and the Ummah The courses on how to make explosives are widely available on the internet Alhamdulillah There are Mujahid brothers who are working on such short courses as well which would teach a normal Muslim how to carry out such operations and also include the necessary precautions needed In these courses , it will be precisely covered as to what necessary measures are needed to execute a successful operation in the West Brothers who use Internet and are good in collecting data can massively contribute in countering drone technology , by : a ) Passing any information regarding drones as much as you can to us on our Azan email address safely ( never email us from your home , friend's home , school and workplace ) If it is a video link then copy the link and send it to us b ) Informing us of the location of drone bases in the USA and the whereabouts of drone operators c ) Informing us of the drone manufacturers , their partners and location d ) Researching on what type of frequency drones use to maintain the link to its satellite Is this an RF , Ultrasonic or any other frequency ? Richard Clarke , former counter-terrorism advisor to the White House and current ABC News consultant commented after the first Issue of Azan Magazine "" Taking over the controls of a drone is beyond the capabilities of members of such militant organizations For that to happen they need to hack into the private encrypted network of the Pentagon or physically overpower the links between the drone and GPS with airplanes , which these organization do not have . We call on our skillful Muslim brothers who are engineers and scientists to come forward and try their best in figuring out how to break the link between drone and GPS Experiment in whichever part of the world you live and if it's successful , make a complete video demonstration of the process , upload it on the web and make it password protected Then send that link and password to us Or simply make a good graphical presentation in Power Point and send it to us Even if you have made good progress in the experiment but encountered some complication in it then send it to us , maybe we can suggest something useful to you Our brothers who are computer engineers and programmers - who can hack into the private encrypted network of the Pentagon , try your best to do so The whole Ummah knows that we have no shortage of brilliant computer programmers and hackers If only one brother takes the initiative and attempts to hack the Pentagon , he'll set an excellent example for other brothers to follow suit Like after the martyrdom operation of 9 , some people initiated the martyrdom operations and then , with the Help of Allah , they became popular amongst the Ummah and turned out to be the most deadliest of weapons to be utilized against the Crusader Zionist alliance This is one of the most important methods generally to counter Kufr and specifically to counter Drones Since this is a lengthy topic , I'll stick to my suggestions on how brothers can give Dawah and contribute in countering drones and helping the global Jihad The security check in Muslim countries of Middle East , Subcontinent and Africa is relatively low as compared to the Western Kafir countries So for example , if you are a university student in Kuala Lumpur ( Malaysia ) you can download Azan Magazine or Inspire Magazine from the Internet , print it and distribute it safely in your University or Masjid Make a fake Facebook account and create a page for Azan Magazine , do some advertisement for the Magazine and reach out to our brothers in the West If you are not an engineer who can break the link between drones and GPS , then send this suggestion to the engineer who you know can do it for Islam Try to find that Hacker in Jakarta or Jeddah who can work only for Allah and be the candidate for the luxurious Jannah Print the one page posters or the front page of Azan and Inspire Magazine and stick it to the public buses in Lahore and Mumbai Do whatever you can to spread the word of Tawheed and Jihad To summarize , this is the phase of the battle in which every Muslim can contribute to the global Jihad in whatever capacity they can Above are humble suggestions to our brothers eager to help Islam We , under the American drones and jet bombardments of the apostate governments , pray for the whole Ummah and especially for our brothers who are helping and contributing in the cause of Allah May Allah protect the elite force ( our brothers in the West ) who are planning attacks in their homelands We only seek the Pleasure of Allah , and it is He alone who guides to the right path And may peace and blessings be upon our Master , Muhammad , his family , and companions Our last prayer is that all praise belongs to Allah , The Lord of the Worlds "
1,"All Praise is due to Allah Alone , The All - Mighty , All-Wise ... And may His Peace and Blessings be upon Prophet Muhammad his companions and all those who follow him till the Day of Judgment In the glorious history of our Muslim Ummah , there have been many high points and there have been many low points as well ; but one main theme has persisted throughout the lives of all those who yearned to give glory to this Ummah : They remembered and acted upon the legacy of their predecessors We live in a day and age when we have lost connection with our history ; the nations that have ruled over the Muslim Ummah for a long time have rendered us blind to the passion , brilliance and valor of our pious predecessors – from the time of the Sahaba up till even now We do not recognize who our heroes or role models truly are Names like Khalid bin Waleed , Sultan Jalaluddin Khwarizm , Noor-ud-Din Zangi , Salahuddin Ayyubi , Tipu Sultan , Imam Shamil , Umar Mukhtar ( May Allah accept their efforts ) fail to strike a chord with us today whereas in actuality , they would raise the hairs on our backs if we truly knew who these people were ... Their lives are sufficient to inspire a generation of individuals to change their lives and live freely ..But unfortunately , the world with all its glamor and deception has deceived us ... We are too busy with our universities , our 9-5 jobs and our mundane routines to think about ever emulating the example of someone like Salahuddin ( RA ) or Jalaluddin ( RA ) or ever letting our children follow their example Our children grow up learning about Da Vinci , Napoleon , Shakespeare , Einstein , Lincoln and other such people who were – in the reality of things – none but Kuffar who failed to live their life according to how their Creator asked of them And their destination is undoubtedly Hell ... "" Those who disbelieve and deny Our signs - they are the people of the Fire .

1,"All Praise is due to Allah Alone ... And may Peace and Blessings be upon Prophet Muhammad The world media is adamant at portraying the Sunni-Shia conflict as "" sectarian "" ; wherever skirmishes between them take place , there is talk around the world of how gaps need to be bridged between the Sunni and Shia "" Muslim "" communities On the 10th of Muharram this year , in Rawalpindi Pakistan , there came yet more proof that the Shia are not in fact Muslims ; rather , they are one of the most dangerous of the Kuffar who are waging a continuous , undeclared war against the real Muslims From Syria to Iraq to Pakistan to their political stronghold ( Iran ) , the Shias have infiltrated into key positions of the secular democratic systems – be it in the parliaments , the Civil Bureaucracies or the Militaries – and they are utilizing these positions to wage war against the Muslim populations In one of their processions of Ashura ( when they gather together to remorse for the killing of Hussain and beat their own selves ) in Rawalpindi , Pakistan , the Shias gathered outside a large Islamic Institution – the Madrassah Ta'leem-ul-Quran The Madrassah faculty told them to avoid going through the route of the Masjid during the Friday prayers – either to choose another route or to delay their procession But the Shias , fuelled with their hatred of the Muslims , chose to go through that same route They torched the Madrassah and set it on fire Furthermore , they snatched rifles from the policemen and killed around 70 people – consisting of students of the Madrassah and those who had gone there to pray The strange thing is that the Police allowed all of this to happen and did not interfere ; neither did the Military , who have a Military Unit just 2 km away from the site of the incident , besides having their General Head Quarters ( GHQ ) in the same city The media images show the Shia snatching guns from policemen and opening fire at the innocent Muslims A Pakistani Politician reported that the media personnel present at the incident were confronted , and their video tapes were taken out of their cameras and destroyed to hide the terrible crimes the Shia were committing The Madrassah administration later informed an Azan Magazine inside reporter that 70 people died in the incident whereas the whereabouts of 100 students were unknown Local shopkeepers , even days after the incident , said that body parts were still being found as the rubble was being cleared The Government imposed a 3 - day curfew after the incident so that there would be no backlash and the local citizens would not get to the reality of what actually happened Even the media did not report the incident adequately The Army  Police sent the bodies of the killed to their families during the curfew Major religious parties , however , disappointed and let down the entire , resourceful Muslim population of the country by saying that they would make "" peaceful protests "" and that they do not want "" violence "" in the country However , local citizens voiced their anguish at the incident with a resident of a nearby area saying , "" Only Taliban possess the ability to teach these Shias a lesson ! Indeed , it is only with the sword that such horrendous killings can be prevented and the only solution for all Muslims lies in the re-establishment of the just Islamic Khilafah , and the waging of Jihad against all transgressors "
1,"Allah says : "" Truly This Ummah of yours is one Ummah , and I am your Lord , so worship Me ( Alone ) . [ 21:92 ] "" And hold fast , all of you together , to the Rope of Allah ( i . e this Quran ) , and be not divided among yourselves ... "" [ 3:103 ] The Prophet said : "" It pleases Allah for you to acquire three qualities and displeases Him that you acquire three characteristics It pleases Him that you worship Him Alone and not associate anything or anyone with Him in worship , that you hold on to the Rope of Allah altogether and do not divide , and that you advise whoever Allah appoints as your Leader The three that displease Him are that you say , ` It was said , ' and , ` So-and-so said , ' asking many unnecessary questions and wasting money . [ Bukhari ] The "" nation state "" has destroyed the unity of the Ummah and split it into bits and pieces , entirely vulnerable to the plans of the Kuffar The great Mujahid leader , Shaykh Dr . Ayman Al-Zawahiri ( HA ) sums up the Muslim loss in a few impeccable words : "" My free and honorable brothers , who are eager to help Islam and liberate Palestine We must read history and comprehend its lessons Palestine was lost when the Khilafah fell and we were dominated by secularism and territorial nationalism which has torn us apart and continues to tear us apart One of the fundamental interests of the West and the Zionists , and indeed , one of the necessities of their existence , is that they divide us by spreading the principles of the secular nationalist nation state and homeland among us , so that we become crumbs that they can easily devour As a result of this ethnic and territorial nationalism , we broke apart after the fall of the Khilafah into more than fifty helpless vassal states . The reviver of Jihad , Shaykh Abdullah Azzam ( RA ) said : "" Sykes and Picot created borders for us They said to us , Jordan ends here at ar-Ramtha , and Syria begins after Ar-Ramtha , and Jordan begins after Harat Ammar And Kuwait Here it is The city of Kuwait , the "" state "" of Kuwait ... And the state of Qatar is a single city And so is the state of Bahrain And Lebanon Here it is ... the size of a coin ""That's the state of Lebanon And here is Syria Listen , this is your land and your birthplace , and love of one's homeland is part of faith And so on ... And so we have begun to think in an "" Islamic way "" which is in truth not an Islamic way but rather , a territorial way of thinking daubed with Islam The Jordanian in Ar-Ramtha sees the resident of Dara'a [ across the Syrian border ] being slaughtered in front of him by the Nusayrites ; yet , he does not even bat an eyelid , move a muscle , or take an extra heartbeat ; nor is he prepared to open the borders Why Because Islam ends at Ar-Ramtha ; and he has nothing to do with Islam in Dara'a But when a Jordanian in Al-'Aqaba winces in pain , you'll find the same person ( from Ar-Ramtha ) up in arms , although the distance between Al-'Aqaba and Ar-Ramtha is more than 600 km , while the di erence between al-Ramtha and Dara'a is less than 6 km This isn't an Islamic attitude ; this isn't the attitude of "" Truly This Ummah of yours is one Ummah , and I am your Lord , so worship Me ( Alone ) . [ 21:92 ] This isn't the global outlook of Islam which says : India is ours and China is ours India is ours and China is ours And the earth is ours and all is ours Islam has become our religion And the entire world is our homeland The constitution of Allah is our religion And we have made our hearts its home . All Muslims are united upon true faith in Allah , His Messenger and His Final Book However , these false lines have been etched upon us on the basis of which entire political , military , economic and cultural institutions have been established that seek division between the Pakistani and the Indian , between the Egyptian and the Turk , between the Chechen and the Uzbek There is no reality in these divides As has been emphasized earlier in the article , in Islam , divide between humanity is upon faith , upon love for Allah and His Messenger So , we as an Ummah must take practical steps to defeat this divided mentality and erase these map lines physically that indoctrinate the Ummah into believing in this false separation Another devastating aspect of the imposition of the nation state upon the Muslim Ummah was the discontinuation and destruction of the concept of Jihad for the sake of Allah Jihad is a firm obligation upon the Muslim Ummah to defend the Muslims and their lands , spread the Dawah of Islam and establish Allah's Rule on earth As Allah says : "" Jihad is ordained for you ( Muslims ) though you dislike it , and it may be that you dislike a thing which is good for you and that you like a thing which is bad for you Allah knows but you do not know "" [ 2:216 ] However , after the fall of the Khilafah a lot of the Muslim lands that underwent the secular transformation built armies that had a new agenda and a new philosophy The author of the book , "" Important Rulings Regarding the State of the Militaries of the Ummah "" writes : "" The crusader establishment did not leave the Muslim lands until after it had created systems and promoted leaders with whom they would be pleased and who would safeguard their interests in the region ... "" The First World War saw the Khilafah Uthmaniah side with Austria and Germany against the Allies ( Britain , France and Russia ) The Khilafah and the allies were defeated in this war and henceforth disintegration started to spread As stated in the previous issues , by 1924 – the Khilafah ceased to exist The Khilafah served as a united front for the Muslims , and Jihad for the sake of Allah was fought under its banner despite its weakness during its final years However , after the fall of the Khilafah , a new phenomenon managed to surface that had its influence in Europe's deification of the "" state "" The secular state borrowed from Europe held the view that the army of the state must possess its loyalty to the "" state "" and to its man-made constitution It is organized to uphold the "" rule of law "" These armies were created on the pattern of the Western nationalistic armies and their aims of establishment were to uphold the rule of law of the Taghut and to uphold alliance and enmities for the sake of the state and not for Allah Dr . Khalid Mehmand writes in his excellent book entitled , "" Theories of Modern Warfare "" : "" The French revolution is the most important event in modern human history Due to it , a secular system of life was implemented in Europe in place of the papal  kingship  landlordism that had existed previously The church – which used to safeguard God's Sovereignty – was abolished and sovereignty was handed over to the people , as democracy replaced kingship Hence , man's purpose of life was declared to be ' capitalistic progress ' In the social vacuum created by the French revolution , a major issue was that of the royal army The royal soldiers would fight , considering the king as ' God's Shadow ' on earth They would consider the King's defeat as their own and they would consider it a religious obligation to sacrifice their lives for him But now , after the secular revolution , there was no room for such beliefs At the same time , it was a given that a military could not be incited to wage war without a clear ideology , a strong mutual bond and a strong certainty in their principles Therefore , the European states needed an ideology to keep their militaries alive and united The answer to the Europeans ' question was delivered by a General from Prussia named Clausewitz Clausewitz ' ideology of war is considered the ' Bible ' in the organization of the modern nationalistic armies The Westerners and their blind followers consider Clausewitz as the ' prophet ' of modern militarism ... ... Clausewitz ' ideology could not attain public attention during his life In 1833 , he became ill . After his death , his widow converted his ideas into a book and published it But despite this , the book did not attain any substantial attention ..In 1871 , the French King Napoleon III attacked Austria In this war , the Austrian military was under the command of Clausewitz ' most able student , General Moltke General Moltke had organized the Austrian military according to the ideas of Clausewitz The French suffered a most devastating defeat in this war The whole of Europe was shocked at Austria's victory And when it was found that Clausewitz ' ideas were the reason behind the victory , the whole of Europe started to organize their forces according to this ideology The Muslim Ummah had become so weak at that point that the Khilafah Uthmaniah had appointed General Moltke to organize their military forces The other military powers at the time also organized the armies of the newly populated regions according to these ideas So Britain which had occupied India , and France which had occupied Algeria organized their armies according to these ideas And in this way , in a period of less than 70 years , almost all countries ' forces were organized according to Clausewitz's ideas , until these newly formed nationalistic armies even became known as ' Clausewitz's Armies ' ""What's important for us to understand is that after the end of the USSR , now almost on all fronts , our battle is against these Clausewitz armies Whether it is the American or European forces or the forces that are implanted upon our necks ... All of them have the same basic philosophy and ideology Possibly , it is the result of this philosophical and ideological a nity that all of these ( nationalistic "" Muslim "" Armies and Kafir Armies ) have easily united upon this one plan of destroying Islam Thus they have become like one International Dajjali Army that has unleashed upon the Muslim Ummah ... ... For any Army , the most important aspect is its ideology of war It is on the basis of this ideology that the soldiers fight and lay down their lives The ideology of war is actually a collection of questions ... For example , What is war Why does man engage in war Where does man obtain the spirit to fight Why does man kill other men like him and who gives him permission to do so Which war is justified and which isn't Who has the authority to wage war and who doesn't Etc A believer who believes in Allah Alone gets all these questions answered via his faith , belief and religion However , when the West denied Allah ' s right to legislate after the secular French revolution , they had to answer these questions to motivate their soldiers for war So , this job was accomplished for them by Clausewitz And today , under the secular system prevalent in the world , all the nation-state armies ( even those in the Muslim-majority countries ) are organized according to Clausewitz ' ideology of war , and they fight on its basis Let us consider these in detail : Clausewitz had the following goals in mind while newly organizing the armies : To transform the royal army into a nationalistic army ; To convert the royal soldier into a nationalistic soldier ; To change the ideology of war ; To adapt the army's organizational framework according to this ideology To obtain these goals , Clausewitz had the following main ideas in mind : Just Force : According to Clausewitz , the Democratic state is the one "" rightful power "" that can order war Apart from this , there is no other power that has the authority to wage war – neither God , nor religion , nor Shariah , nor the scholars ( We seek refuge with Allah ) War : A Continuation of the State's Policy : According to Clausewitz , ' war ' is a state's political tool , or a continuation of the state's policy It is the result of this very ideology that despite bearing all kinds of power and ability , all the armies of the Muslim Ummah do not fight Jihad in the way of Allah ; rather , they fight under the command of the democratic Government and to safeguard the interests of the state Thus , even if the Shariah ordains Jihad , and the state's policy is against it , then these armies do not wage war And if the Shariah forbids fighting and the state's policy dictates war , these armies forego all Shariah commands and jump into these wars The History of the Regiment – The Catalyst for War : The basic unit of the Army according to Clausewitz is the Regiment A lot of Divisions combine together to make a Regiment Then the Division is one unit of a military power According to Clausewitz , the'Regiment'is a complete society Clausewitz contends that man gains the willingness to fight due to two reasons : a collective reason i . e the spirit of patriotism , and then an individual reason i . e a deep connection with the history of the Regiment Therefore , Clausewitz connects the royal soldier , who previously fought considering the king as the shadow of God , with his Regiment's history and in doing so provides him with a new stimulus and a fresh wave of emotion Therefore , that ' royal soldier ' is now converted to a ' national soldier ' Then , experience also proved that even though patriotism is a powerful factor in drawing the soldier to the battle eld , but during battle , he sacri ces his life only for greater glori cation of his Regiment's ' golden history ' and for increasing his Regiment's honor and grandeur In short , according to Clausewitz , the Regiment's history has proved to be a more powerful stimulus for war than patriotism Thus , if the soldier is a liated openly with the dark reality of his Regiment's ' glorious history ' , then his motivation for fighting can be easily driven off Civilized and Uncivilized War : According to Clausewitz , war is of two types : ' Civilized war ' and ' Uncivilized war ' Civilized war is that which is waged on the order of the nation-state because it is the nation-state that is the guardian of the new civilization Hence , whatever war the state wages , that shall be civilized "" Non-state actors "" ( e . g Mujahideen , Ulema ) therefore , have no right to wage war in the first place ; and if they do wage war , then that war will be called an "" uncivilized war "" The Legal Justification for Bearing Arms : On this basis , he divides the society into "" legally armed individuals "" and "" illegally armed individuals "" The army soldier is the legally armed individual of the society while if rest of the society bears arms , their bearing arms is declared illegal In reality , according to Clausewitz , it is only the democratic state that can give man the authority to bear arms Other than it , there is no one who has the right to give an individual or a group the right to bear arms Now since the "" state "" has given the military and the police the right to bear arms , hence it is "" lawful "" for them to do so ; while it is "" unlawful "" for others to do the same The Selection of the Soldier for the Army : Special attention has been given to the individuals of the society in selecting a national soldier In this lieu , the philosophy of a "" Martial Race "" and a "" Military Mind "" has been presented According to this ideology , in every nation and country , there exist certain individuals who possess weak personalities and thought processes , but are highly ambitious Such individuals have a greater capability of becoming national soldiers Due to their weak personalities and thought processes , such people are unable to rebel against their country and army and due to their high ambitions , they stay at the forefront in causing loss to the enemy's army After understanding the ideologies of Clausewitz , we can easily understand how Clausewitz connected the Royal Soldier with the democratic Government First , a weak personality is selected Then such a person is connected with nationalism and the Regiment's history Then this Regiment is connected with the Brigade , the Division and the ( whole ) military During training , the soldier is told that the only lawful power for ordering war is the democratic state Other than it , there is no power that has the authority to order war Similarly , he is also told that it is only the uniformed soldier who bears arms on the order of the state , who can fight a civilized and lawful war Whoever bears arms other than the soldier ... even if with the intention of Jihad ... he is the perpetrator of an "" uncivilized "" , "" illegal "" act At this time , the militaries of the entire world – whether in the West or in the Muslim countries – are organized according to these Kufr ideologies of Clausewitz Hence , it is not possible for these nationalistic militaries to play any role in establishing the Khilafah and waging Jihad in the Path of Allah These armies have their own formulated beliefs and ideologies and their own thought and philosophy Their way of thought , organization , goals and aims are all separate from those of this Ummah , and run contrary to Islam Hence , it is utterly impossible for these armies to be converted to "" Islamic armies "" via some minor changes These are not "" our armies "" ..They are "" armies of the West "" Let alone waging Jihad , they are the main obstacle in establishing Khilafah and waging Jihad May Allah rid us off them Ameen ! The reality is that after the fall of the Khilafah and the rise of the nation state , these nationalistic Armies were implanted upon the Muslim Ummah – and many of the Muslims were made to believe that Jihad was the duty of these armies and the rest of the Ummah was absolved of this duty What this meant was that the spirit of Jihad to establish the Rule of Allah faded away from the masses and the scholars , and Islam became restricted to the Masjid and the madrassah For a long time , the Ummah became dormant – some of which might have been due to considering the "" country "" or "" nation state "" as properly Islamic and some of which might have been due to foregoing the duty of Jihad , by considering it the job of the Military Even today , many Muslims mistakenly believe that they are absolved of the duty of Jihad because that is the job of the Army and the Police We seek refuge with Allah Maulana Zahid Iqbal , an esteemed Islamic scholar who has written books on many of the critical contemporary issues faced by the Muslim Ummah , writes in his book "" Asr-e-Hazir main Ghalaba-e-Deen ka Nabwi Tareeqa-e-Kar "" ( The Prophetic Method of giving victory to the religion in the Contemporary Times ): "" In the countries that obtained freedom from the imperialistic powers , the biggest hurdle faced by the Islamic movements that sought to establish the Islamic system and the Shariah Law , has been the ( Nationalistic ) Army Whenever these Islamic movements neared victory through protests , demands and the democratic way , the military snatched the Rule and declared these ( Islamic ) groups as illegal ; or the military used its influence and power to dissolve legislative assemblies and deny the standpoint of the parties that had reached the assemblies through democratic elections and their public support It is worth pondering upon for those people who are trying to revive Islam that how come the Army played such a role against the Islamic parties in all of the Muslim countries that gained independence from the imperialistic powers If one researches and ponders deeply , it becomes really clear that the imperialistic powers are behind it They hired local people in the new-population period and trained them in their particular ideology ; on the one hand , they gave increase to their period of rule and used them against their fellow-country Mujahideen who were fighting for freedom , while on the other , they left , as their inheritors , such people who were not only the protectors of the systems , ideologies , societies and constitutions implemented by these powers , but who also served , through proper planning , to stop any and all attempts to establish Islam These same establishment powers also created a class of civil bureaucrats who played part in this These two classes ( Military and Civil Bureaucracy ) till today are acting upon these imperialistic agendas and are the main obstacle behind the establishment of Islam Both of these classes of people were promoted to higher ranks on the promise that they would block the progress of those who call for Islam and of the establishment of the Islamic system After 9 , the filtering out of people linked to Islam from the Pakistani Army is a clear evidence of this Hence , those who are striving to revive the Khilafah must ponder upon this issue and come up with a method to get rid of this big obstacle ( The Army ) . The point that we intend to drive home is that these armies are not Muslim armies They fight for the establishment of man-made law , not the law of Allah They openly conspire with the enemies of Islam to kill the Mujahid sons of this Ummah Their open declarations of being "" front line allies in the war against terror "" shout out their real agendas If Muslim Rule is again to be established anywhere in the Muslim Ummah , this corrupt institution needs to be completely uprooted and re-organized , and in its place , a Muslim Mujahid institution that orders the good and forbids the evil , that upholds the Rule of the Quran , that considers it its duty to safeguard the Muslims of the East and the West , and that seeks to re-capture Jerusalem from the wretched hands of the Jews – needs to be implemented And it is for this greater goal that the battle elds of Syria , Iraq , Pakistan , Afghanistan etc are decorated In Sha Allah "
1,"The nations of the kuffar have gathered together in order to defeat Islam and its defenders There is not any Muslim nation except that they have attacked it openly or covertly However , their efforts have not come to fruition ; they are losing their wars abroad and have angered their Muslim populations at home One of the nations at the head of this war against Islam is Britain This is a nation that has a long history of hatred towards Islam and the Muslims In the centuries gone by , it was at the forefront of the fight against Islam and now it is America's most loyal ally But it has faced the consequences of its aggression Alhamdulillah , the Muslims in Britain know where their loyalties should lie ; this was shown by the spectacular martyrdom operations on 7  2005 , when 4 Mujahideen , all who had been brought up in Britain , gave their lives in order to defend their Ummah Their motives were clearly expressed in their videotaped statements ; Muhammad Sidique Khan said : "" Your democratically elected governments continuously perpetuate atrocities against my people all over the world And your support of them makes you directly responsible , just as I am directly responsible for protecting and avenging my Muslim brothers and sisters Until we feel security , you will be our targets and until you stop the bombing , gassing , imprisonment and torture of my people , we will not stop this fight We are at war and I am a soldier Now you too will taste the reality of this situation . There have been other attacks by British born Muslims in order to avenge their Ummah The brave Mujahidah , Roshanara Choudary , stabbed Stephen Timms , a Member of Parliament , due to him voting in favour of invading Iraq And last May , brothers Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale beheaded Lee Rigby , a British soldier who had served in Afghanistan Michael Adebolajo said : "" We swear by Almighty Allah we will never stop fighting you The only reason we killed this man is because Muslims are dying daily This British soldier is an eye for an eye , a tooth for tooth . These are some of the attacks that were successful and besides these are numerous attempted attacks that were unsuccessful So what has been the reaction of the British government towards these attacks Any rational person would think that they would address the root cause of this issue , that being their own aggression against the Muslim Ummah But that has not been the case ; their hostility towards Islam and the Muslims is as bad as it has ever been Instead of stopping their war against the Muslims , they in fact increased their oppressive behaviour Soon after 9 they enacted new ' anti-terrorism ' legislation which made it legal for them to imprison any non-British citizen who they merely suspected to be ' terrorist ' and keep them in prison indefinitely without charge After this law was passed , many Muslims were imprisoned without knowing for what reason they had been deprived of their liberty The period they could detain a ' terrorist ' without charge went up from 7 days , to 14 days , then 28 days and the government had asked for 90 days detention without charge , but were defeated narrowly in a parliamentary vote Stop and search powers were also enhanced to allow police o cers to search anyone without suspicion of any criminal offence having been committed This new draconian legislation was made specifically to target the Muslim community They were not satisfied with the restriction of only being able to arrest non-British Muslims without evidence So in 2005 they introduced what they termed ' Control Orders ' With this act in place , any Muslim who the British government believe may pose a threat to them can be put under a control order The ' controlee ' is not told for what crime he has been punished ; no evidence is needed to be brought forward against him , and his case is dealt with in a secret court in which neither he nor his lawyers may be present So much for ' civil liberty ' and ' habeas corpus ' Here is a list of some of the restrictions ' controlees ' have : Electronic GPS tagging ; A daily requirement to show up at the local police station ; Up to 16 hours residence curfew ; The police can raid their house whenever they decide to without a warrant ; Restrictions from meeting with anybody ; Nobody can visit their house without home o ce approval ; A geographical boundary ( usually a couple of miles radius from their home ); Restrictions of studying and working In 2012 , ' control orders ' were replaced with Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures ( TPIMs ) Although the name had changed , the details of the act were virtually identical This new legislation hasn't helped Britain defeat the so-called ' terrorist ' threat In fact , the threat of attacks is more severe than ever The kuffar do not only have to worry about Mujahideen sending cells to their lands from the arenas of jihad ; they are also increasingly facing the growing threat of ' lone Mujahid ' attacks in which Muslims living amongst them take up their responsibility of fighting the Crusader enemy individually Those Muslims who are put on control orders  TPIMs are of 2 categories : the first being innocent Muslims unfairly oppressed and not being able to have a fair trial and the second being Mujahideen who are easily able to escape and join their respective Jihadi organisations once again The Muslim youth in Britain have their loyalty with the Muslim Ummah and the Mujahideen It is estimated that around 2000 Muslims are on the terrorist watch list Hundreds of young Muslims have recently left Britain to join the Mujahideen in Syria , and many may return in order to carry out attacks The so-called bearers of human rights have abandoned all of their principles in their fight against Islam and the Muslims Those who turn their backs on their principles are the true losers Their citizens are disgusted by the loss of their own civil liberties and are afraid that their nation has become a police state This is clearly displayed in the 2012 Olympics , in which spectators were welcomed by snipers on rooftops and machine gun wielding police officers on the streets It can be expected that the British government will carry on with its current policies It will not abandon its neo-colonial foreign agenda in the Muslim world This will result in continuing anger amongst the Muslim population in Britain , some of whom will take heed of the Mujahideen's call to attack the Crusader nations in their own lands This increasing threat will be countered by more draconian legislation by the British government ; the media will continue to demonise Islam and the Muslims and far-right organisation like the EDL will be allowed to attack Muslim areas The Muslims in Britain have tough choices to make for the future Slowly but surely the noose is being tightened on them They might want to live as peaceful citizens in Britain , turning a blind eye to the oppression that the nation they reside in is doing to their brothers and sisters in the Muslim world But the truth and falsehood will always clash ; the British government already attacked the Muslims who speak openly on the topic of Jihad , now they have been going after those they term ' Islamists ' After they have dealt with them they will oppress the Muslims wholesale Maybe the Muslims of today will escape this brutality , but it will surely come to their children's generation Our advice to the Muslims of Britain is that they should join the Mujahideen They need to attack the kuffar in Britain where it hurts in order to avenge the blood of their brothers and sisters in the Muslim world If not then they should join the Mujahideen abroad or at least make hijrah away from the enemy and move to Muslim majority countries as the Islamic revolution is spreading throughout the Muslim world "
1,"The Mujahideen of Iraq have established a firm presence in the cities of Ramadi and Fallujah The weak Shi'a government of Nuri Al-Maliki has begged the remnants of the Awakening Council to fight the Mujahideen and expel them from the cities However , after a month of fighting the government and apostates , the Mujahideen are still in control of Fallujah and many neighbourhoods in Ramadi The events follow a crackdown on a Sunni anti-government protest camp in late December Following the demolition of the camp , dozens of ' Sunni ' MP's resigned from the parliamentary seats If it wasn't obvious before , it is obvious now that the Shi'a government will not accept any objection to their oppression of the Sunnis ; and that the only solution is Jihad On successive days in late December , two martyrdom operations were carried out on the transport network More than 30 kuffar were killed altogether The attacks were carried out by Caucasus Emirate , led by Amir Dokka Umarov The attacks show the growing capability of the Caucasus Emirate to carry out strikes outside the North Caucasus region The Jihad of the Caucusus has been going on for quite a long time , and In Sha Allah , the time is soon when the sacrifices shall bear fruit On Friday , the 17th of January , Mujahideen of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan attacked a restaurant frequented by the occupying forces Many kuffar were killed in the attack , including staff of the UN and IMF Amongst the killed were invaders from America , Britain , Canada , Denmark and Russia Zabihullah Mujahid , spokesman for the Islamic Emirate said that the attack was carried out to avenge a US air strike in Parwan province that killed dozens of civilians , "" These invading forces launched a brutal bombardment on civilians ... and they have martyred and wounded 30 civilians This was a revenge attack and we did it well , and we will continue to do so . By the Grace of Allah , the Jihad of Afghanistan is maturing by leaps and bounds and under the leadership of Mulla Muhammad Umar , the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan is soon to be re-established by the Will of Allah Our Muslim Ummah The events in Bangladesh are a clear proof of the collusion of the western media , as well as the media in the Islamic world , with the political leadership in the West , India , and the enemies of Islam generally Thousands of people were massacred in the streets of Bangladesh , yet no one mobilized for their plight Instead , the media passed over the incident in a very casual manner The Government issued a statement saying that the death toll was only around a hundred So thousands are killed , and more continue to die , in Bangladesh , but the West is unmoved India even expressed its pleasure over the tragedy America and India continue to provide the corrupt Bangladeshi government with even more aid Similarly , when more than five thousand people are killed in Egypt , and their bodies are burned in the streets , America calls for calm and reconciliation And when millions of Muslims are killed in Afghanistan , Iraq , Palestine , Kashmir , the Philippines , Gujarat , Ahmadabad , and Somalia , the whole world is unmoved When the people of Afghanistan , Mali , and Somalia demand freedom from foreign occupation and secular rulers and decide to implement Shariah , imposing economic sanctions becomes a ' necessity ' They are then met with a full-edged military onslaught , in which the leading international criminals and their local surrogates take part Their villages and homes are reduced to ruins Their women and children are killed In short , they are unable to establish the Shariah because they are ' terrorists ' and ' enemies of freedom ' But when Salman Rushdie , Tasleema Nasreen , and Ali Rajab Haider insult Islam , the Prophet of Islam , and the beliefs of Islam , they are treated as heroes who must be defended , honoured , and given awards They even get warm receptions in the White House or Ten Downing Street Why Because they are icons of freedom who are defended by the West and the enemies of Islam As for the Muslim prisoners in Guantanamo and the secret prisons of the CIA , they do not deserve freedom They must be tortured , deprived of their rights and imprisoned without any sentence by a court for the long periods determined by the American government on its own This is because they are not ' humans ' in the first place for America to give them any ' human rights ' They are not subject to those conventions by which America is bound in its treatment of the rest of humanity This is the logic of power and arrogance This is not about human rights ; it is about the rights of the man who opposes Islam It is about his rights when he is aggressing against a Muslim This is the arrogant attitude of the West that the great Imam and Reviver , Shaykh Usama bin Laden ( may Allah have mercy on him ) , fully understood He confronted them with the logic that they understand He confronted them with the language that convinces them : the logic of power in the face of oppression and tyranny , in the eyes of the West freedom means that you must be their slave It means that you must be like a parrot that repeats what the West tells it to say Freedom means that you must beg the West for its a nity and satisfaction But if you invite people to the Unity of Allah ; if you invite them to Islam , Jihad , enjoining good , forbidding evil , and establishing the rule of Shariah , you are a ' terrorist ' The only way to solve the problem that you pose is by bombing , killing and going to war with you It is not your right to rule by your Shariah , even if the overwhelming majority of your people support you This is because democracy is a one-way highway that lands you in a position where you can serve the West But if you try to use democracy to oppose the interests of the West , you are a terrorist ...

1,"The Unavenged Outrage : The Black Plague in our Midst When I was a youngster I used to refer to the black man by the term of "" nigger . At the time this seemed like the natural , uninhibited term to use As I became older , went through college , and was exposed to a liberal education and the mass media brain pollution programs , I changed to the more "" respectable "" term of "" negro . Today , I am most emphatically again using the term nigger In so doing I have been rebuked and criticized by some people that this is being low-brow , uneducated , crude Nothing could be further from the truth The fact is that I have passed through the "" nigger "" stage , the respectable "" negro "" stage , and have finally advanced to the "" nigger "" designation again , because I have found , from a lifetime of experience and from a lengthy study of the subject , that the term nigger is by far the most correct and proper term to use Furthermore , in looking up the word in Webster's dictionary I found the term "" nigger "" very descriptive : "" a vulgar , offensive term of hostility and contempt for the black man . I can't think of anything that defines better and more accurately what our position toward the nigger should be than what the dictionary said If we are going to be for racial integrity and racial purity and for supremacy of the White Man , we should and we must take a hostile position toward the nigger We must give him nothing but contempt The black man is without a doubt the most dangerous creature on the face of the earth to the further survival of the White Race He is a danger that rivals that of the Jew himself , although for different reasons Granted , the Jew is by far the greater overall danger in manipulating and destroying the White Race He could , however , never completely destroy the White Race without the help of the nigger without completely exterminating the White Race This , of course , the Jew does not want to do , because he would then be deprived of a productive slave element to furnish him with all the better essentials of a plush standard of living The central aim and objective of the Jewish conspiracy in destroying past White civilizations always has been , and always will be , and is today : the pulling down of the White Race ; poisoning its blood and mongrelizing it to become a mulatto race of bastards , one which he can easily control He knows very well that as long as the White Race remains pure , there is always the danger that a sleeping giant can awaken , turn on him , and destroy him One of the most infuriating con games the Jews play on the Whites is to parade a mulatto , perhaps 7 White , on the T . V screens as a "" typical black . Whereas any intelligence such a miserable mixed-breed may have , undoubtedly comes from its predominantly White ancestry , total credit is allotted to the mulatto as being black In picking and choosing an unusual mulatto that is able to make a halfway decent presentation , the Jews thereby take the talent and ability derived from the White blood and use it to boost the stock of the niggers A most shabby and treacherous deception , but most Whites unfortunately have not caught on If they were to expose a pure black African nigger he would , undoubtedly , be too repulsive to sell to the American public The Jews therefore use mulattos extensively — not only half and half — but mulattos with predominantly White ancestry Most of the "" professional "" blacks such as the late Congressman Adam Clayton Powell , have very little nigger blood in them — just enough to darken their skin Thus equipped they then become professional nigger promoters , displaying themselves as a typical nigger The only reason they get away with this , of course , is because they have the full support of the Jewish news media behind them , giving them ample favorable exposure in a thousand different ways The black African represents the lowest scale in the human ladder Throughout recorded history over the last 6000 years the African has invented nothing He has not even so much as invented the wheel , although he has had plenty of opportunity to observe from other nearby races the use of it He has never domesticated a single animal His only means of transporting goods has been the human head as a means of cartage He has never progressed beyond the common mud hut as a means of shelter He has never learned to read or write on his own He has never produced a written language Practically the only trade he has ever indulged in is the trading of ivory , beads and slaves , in other words , the sale and trading of his own kinsmen He is shiftless , lazy and dumb The average pure black African nigger has an I . Q about 40 points lower than the average White This puts his average well below the moron class The average American nigger , having assimilated a large quantity of White blood and actually being a mulatto , has a somewhat higher I . Q . , somewhere at approximately 80 , a good 20 points below the average White This puts him just on the borderline of the moron classification , with a large percentage being actually in the moron category The nigger is , however , tough , and he is prolific in producing more NIGGERS For all the above reasons mentioned he has been well adapted for slave labor under the direction of a superior race But for the same reasons he is a very useful and dangerous tool in the hands of the Jew , and an extremely dangerous threat to the White Race The Founding Fathers , when they wrote the Declaration of Independence , inserted in it a glaring error , an error that has lived to haunt us ever since In a burst of generosity that was exceeded perhaps only by stupidity , they magnanimously inserted into the Declaration that much heralded phrase , "" All men are created equal . We can be sure that the hand of the Jew was involved in this perversion of the facts of life We can be sure the founding fathers themselves did not believe it They themselves owned numerous slaves , and when a dozen years later they wrote the Constitution , they gave the coloreds a voting "" value "" of three - fifths But even this they did not give to the niggers themselves , but to each State as a whole in calculating their respective representation in Congress The Jew has made much of that treacherous phrase , ignoring the fact that the Founding Fathers did not grant citizenship nor voting rights to the niggers They owned them as slaves and considered them as chattel Today we hear that same statement , that "" all men are created equal , "" dinned into our ears again and again over television , over radio , and in the newspapers , and by means of every other Jewish communication medium Being hammered into our brains day after day , the young people especially , are beginning to believe it The objective of the Jews , of course , is to get us to accept the niggers as our equal , get us to inter-marry They want to mongrelize the White Race , and to pull it down to somewhere near the shameful level of the jungle dwelling cannibals themselves It has been said , and rightfully so , "" You can take the nigger out of the jungle , but you can't take the jungle out of the nigger . This is an eternal truth of Nature Every species is designed to live in its own rightful element A fish out of water would be as much out of place as a polar bear transplanted to the jungles of the tropics A beaver is an expert at building dams but it cannot fly like an eagle nor build a nest like an eagle Conversely , an eagle cannot possibly live the life of a beaver So it is with each species in Nature To each his own , and to each his own pattern of living and his own peculiar environment The nigger , taken out of the jungle and transplanted into the middle of a White Man's civilization is as much out of his element as a fish out of water The harm that was done in forcibly tearing the black man away from Africa and transplanting him into the middle of White America , was not nearly as great to the nigger himself as in future years it was to the White civilization The foul act of tearing the black man from the shores of Africa and injecting him into the New World that was to be the future home of the White Man was a major catastrophe for White civilization It planted the seeds for the future disintegration of a great and beautiful civilization that was flowering in the New World And who was it that indulged in the slave trade almost to a monopoly Why , it was the Jew , in overwhelming numbers , carrying on one of his favorite rackets — that of dealing in human flesh for a profit The Jew had been famous for indulging in the slave trade not only for centuries , but for thousands of years In fact , he was indulging in one of his prime activities , that of dealing in human commodities , or should we say , sub-human commodities , and commercializing on it at the same time In so doing , he was furthering his master plan in two ways : one , he was making money and thereby strengthening his financial monopoly , and two , he was implanting the black jungle blood of Africa into the veins of White America where it could fester and grow until it would finally destroy White America If we are to save ourselves from the black scourge here in America we must first of all redirect the thinking of the White Man We must destroy the shameful lie that "" all men are created equal . We must not only again make the White Man aware of his great heritage and his wonderful gift of blood , but we must make the idea of racial purity the first and foremost passion of our new creed We must , therefore , make every man , woman and child realize the immensity of the gulf that exists between the great White civilization , the great White Race versus the black inhabitants of the jungle We must make them realize that there is a far greater gap between the great intellect of our leading White geniuses and that of the nigger than there is between the nigger and the next highest ape We must guard our precious bloodlines at all costs Therefore , when we think of the black man we must think of his natural habitat being that of the jungle of Africa We must realize and think of him as a creature whose natural level of existence is more closely related to that of animals than it is to the great and high civilization of the White Race We must counteract the Jewish propaganda that is poisoning the minds and the natural instincts of the White people We can best do this by looking at the nigger for what he is , by thinking of him in terms of hostility and contempt We must never refer to him in such a respectful term as "" negro "" but heap contempt and derision upon his head , and call him what he is at all times — a nigger Our proper attitude towards the nigger at all times must be one of hostility and contempt We must speed the day when we are ready to expel this racial poison from the body of White America In order to do this we must re-orient the White Man's thinking until he is ready to do the job that he should have done a long time ago — and that is to cleanse America of the black poison that is within us , to forcibly if necessary , ship the nigger back to Africa from whence he was torn As I have stated repeatedly , the White Man's main problem is not overcoming the black man , or even the perfidious Jew The main problem is to straighten out the White Man's thinking and get him back to sanity Once we have accomplished that much , the rest of the battle will be child's play Once we have restored the White Man's sanity to where his natural instincts will again be performing in accordance with Nature's laws , the battle will be as good as won The White Man , brought back to sanity , and freed from the clutches of Jewish propaganda , is the most powerful force on the face of the earth In fact , the White Man , united and organized , is ten times more powerful than all the rest of humanity put together It is the objective of this book to bring about this situation When the Jews dragged the black man from the shores of Africa and planted him on American soil , they already had integrated into their master plan the means of using the black blood of Africa to destroy the burgeoning White civilization in the New World Not only was the trading in slaves highly profitable to the Jew , but 300 years ago he already knew how he was going to use this African poison to destroy the White Race During the aftermath of the Civil War the Jew launched a tremendous power drive to mongrelize the White blood of the South In this he failed mainly due to the rallying battle of the Ku Klux Klan By the 1880 ' s the southern states had driven the nigger from power and reclaimed his courts , legislatures and government In the early 1900 ' s the Jew launched a new program for the mongrelization of the White Man , under the guise of the communist party This time it was aimed at the entire United States with the spearhead being launched from the Deep South Here is the blueprint as laid down by Jew Israel Cohen in his book entitled "" A Racial Programme for the Twentieth Century "" : "" We must realize that our party's most powerful weapon is racial tension By propounding into the consciousness of the dark races that for centuries they have been oppressed by the Whites , we can mould them to the program of the Communist party In America , we will aim for subtle victory While inflaming the Negro minority against the Whites , we will endeavor to instill in the Whites a guilt complex for their exploitation of the Negroes , we will aid the Negroes to rise in prominence in every walk of life , in the professions and in the world of sports and entertainment With this prestige the Negro will be able to intermarry with the Whites and begin a process which will deliver America to our cause . Basically the program is to instill hatred among the niggers for the Whites — the "" Kill Whitey "" obsession ; at the same time promote "" love "" and "" brotherhood "" among the Whites ; instill a paralyzing guilt complex in the Whites to the point they would do anything to placate the nigger With government , money and the weapons of propaganda in the hands of the Jews , the battle is on A ferocious onslaught is being made by the Jews to mongrelize the races in America in this generation Everything possible has already been done to mix and integrate housing , but even this is not fast enough The Jews know that in order to get interracial marriages accepted and get them in progress , they have to start with the school children at an early age In order to do this , they have done everything possible to push and promote the abominable crime of forced busing of our school children Although this is completely contrary to the Constitution , completely contrary even to the vicious Civil Rights Laws that have been passed in the 1960 ' s , the Jewish judges everywhere have handed down verdicts of forced busing To anybody in their right mind these verdicts are the most vicious , abominable , hideous crimes that anybody could possibly dream up Nevertheless , with the sugar coating and smoothing over by the Jewish-directed news media and propaganda networks , they have made it seem almost reasonable The result is that White school boards and county governments have shamefully abdicated their duty to their electors and to their citizens They have bowed to these scoundrels of Jewish judges Not only have they bowed to them , but in a most abject and shameful manner , have cow-towed to them The consequence of this abomination is clear to everyone Schools have become hotbeds of crime , of knifings , of beatings , of lawlessness , and anarchy The Jewish press blandly goes on its way and acts as if , "" Well there are inconveniences , but My Look at the rewards We must make the Constitution work We must make equal opportunity for everyone . What garbage The obvious facts stand out that none of these idiotic arguments are valid Busing little black savages into White neighborhoods , and conversely busing innocent little White children into the crime ridden blackboard jungles of the nigger districts has not achieved any of these so-called noble objectives The fact is that the schools have downgraded education for both the blacks and the Whites They are not any longer even semblances of educational institutions , but crime ridden penal colonies They are slave labor camps in which our lamentable White children are the victims of a heinous Jewish crime Even the dirty , black niggers don't want to have their children bused , but a few of the Jew-promoted black spokesmen act like this is a must so that they can get "" equal opportunities . In all cases , it is the Jewish financed and controlled "" Legal Defense Fund , "" always with some Jewish kike lawyer at its head , that brings suits before the courts , before a Jewish judge This Jewish judge then hands down an almost unbelievably ridiculous verdict , forcing large-scale busing of White children into the jungles of the black territories , and the fierce little black animals into White suburbs A great deal of opposition has sprung up It must be our objective to capitalize on such opposition , organize it , and introduce these White Racial Comrades to our new creed In Pontiac , Michigan , for instance , a group of White parents calling themselves the National Action Group has organized boycotts that kept 35 percent of Pontiac's White children home on the first day of school Immediately the Jewish controlled police were put into action to make sure that those few White traitors that violated this boycott were protected to the hilt to try and break these boycotts The slogan of the White group was "" Bus Judges , not children . Probably a better slogan would be "" Boating , not busing "" The implication of this slogan , of course , is that we should put the niggers on boats and send them back to Africa instead of busing our poor innocent children It is rather ironical that the most determined opposition to busing has come not from the White people and the White parents who have the most to lose , but from the Chinese racial group in San Francisco Although they live in a country that is not their own and a country in which they are a small minority , these Chinese at least have enough racial loyalty and enough racial pride to stick together Outwardly they claim that their concern is that the children will lose a part of the close-knit community's ancient cultural heritage However , one Chinese American teacher admits , "" At least that is what they say to you , but if you could speak Chinese , you'd learn they just don't want their children going to school with blacks . Even the colored Chinese , whose cultural heritage is much less than that of the magnificent White Race , have enough racial solidarity and loyalty to stick together and know when they are being debauched and debased by mixing with a bunch of inferior black animals As this is being written at least 3000 Chinese children were still boycotting the schools in San Francisco In reading the reviews about the so-called "" problems "" of busing such Jewish propaganda pieces as Time Magazine , Life Magazine , and others present the picture as "" yes , there is a problem , but we will overcome all these obstacles and everybody will be better off , "" and an endless collection of similar drivel The cunning Jew never argues the question : is busing really good for our country Is it really achieving any positive results It is always presented in a manner that , of course everybody knows that we need to have integration , everybody is agreed that this is a highly desirable objective All the while he is preaching this kind of monstrous lie , the Jew knows very well what he is doing He knows that it is completely devastating and ruining our public schools for which the White parents are paying tremendous sums of money in taxation He knows that the net results of this operation will be a mongrelization of the blacks and Whites in the next generation , and that it will pull down , degrade and debauch , destroy and mongrelize the White Race All this time he is deceitfully promoting the idea on a ( seemingly ) most high level plane , as if this were the American dream ; as if this were the law of the land ; as if this is what our Founding Fathers meant by the term "" democracy . They are vigorously promoting the idea that if we could only have this country's races integrated , everything would be just lovely , and a whole flood of similar criminal propaganda ""Let's just examine some of these treacherous and fallacious ideas that the Jews are putting forth and promoting ""Let's look at the claim that this is the law of the land In the first place nowhere in the Constitution is it stated or even implied that schools must be integrated According to the 10th Amendment , which plainly states that all other rights not delegated to the Federal Government are reserved to the states respectively , or to the people , there is no question that schools and education are completely outside of the prerogative and the jurisdiction of the Federal Government It belongs wholly within the jurisdiction of the state governments and the county governments Furthermore , the Founding Fathers never did consider race mixing as a constitutional right In fact , most of the Founding Fathers who wrote the Constitution were themselves owners of slaves , including such people as Jefferson , George Washington and others , who did not necessarily write the Constitution but were rightly considered as our Founding Fathers They never did consider the black niggers as being the equal of the White founders of this nation They considered them all as a chattel property , who were given neither rights of citizenship , nor were they given any voting rights For these Jewish propagandists now to prattle that it was the will of our Founding Fathers that we should forcefully mix the races and bus our White children about like a bunch of cattle is a foul lie of the lowest order Let us further consider that fallacious Jewish argument that this is the law of the land Even the most vicious laws that the Jewish controlled congress has passed in the last decade does not state anywhere that our children must be bused about like a bunch of cattle in order to achieve racial mixture and integration In fact , the notorious and vicious civil rights laws of the 1960 ' s specifically state that federal funds cannot in any case be used for busing to achieve racial integration For these contemptible Jewish judges now to come along and say that this is the law of the land is a lie , and a vicious contemptible lie at that It is neither embodied in the Constitution , nor is it the law of the land In fact even as far back as in 1896 the Supreme Court ruled that separate but equal facilities were constitutional , and in all our past Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence it has always been an established axiom that once a decision was handed down , that future decisions would be governed thereby The presently Jewish-controlled Supreme Court has raped and violated this established jurisprudence and stakes out decisions that are in complete violation of precedent , in complete violation of the laws passed by Congress , and in complete violation of the Constitution itself In any case , I say to you , White Brothers and White Sisters , even if such a vicious code was the law of the land , was imbedded in the Constitution and had been accepted by our courts , there is a higher law that supersedes all these — and that is the law of survival There comes a time when the highest law of Nature must be invoked by whatever means available and this law is the law of preservation of your own species It is therefore one of the holiest causes to which we can dedicate ourselves to expel this racial black poison from out of our national blood stream ; to ship the niggers back to Africa as quickly as possible and cleanse and keep pure our racial integrity We must point out again and again to our White Racial Comrades the horrible facts of present day history , namely : in 1920 the White Race was outnumbered only two to one in the world Today it is outnumbered seven to one , and the Jewish United Nations gleefully predicts that in another 20 years we will be outnumbered 49 to 1 by the hostile colored hordes It does not take a great deal of imagination as to what the fate of the White Race will be when the colored , agitated and controlled by the Jews , have enough physical power to slaughter us The facts of history and the facts of Nature are plain : The White Race must dominate the earth or miserably perish at the hands of the inferior coloreds The first step in the White Man's struggle to save himself must be made right here in America — and that first step is to expel the niggers from our midst and ship them back to Africa It must not be our objective to "" help "" the nigger "" improve "" himself We have no interest whatsoever in "" improving "" and assimilating the nigger into our White society It is the most stupid thing we could possibly do The only thing nigger's produce when they get outside help is — more nigger's The only answer is boating — ship them out This is the only real solution When it comes to implementing the real solution of the nigger problem in America , namely that of shipping the niggers back to Africa , people generally parrot two starkly negative answers , implanted in their brains by Jewish propaganda : ( a ) How can we possibly afford it ( b ) Yes , it would be the sensible thing to do , but you'll never get the American people to do it Both attitudes ( a ) and ( b ) are , of course , intensely negative , just as the Jew tailored them to be He is promoting these ideas along the lines of a sound maxim as old as the strategy of warfare itself — namely , if you can get your enemies to think they are defeated before the battle starts , then they are as good as defeated Let us examine ( a ) Can we afford it And the answer is so overwhelmingly yes , we can In fact , we can't afford not to Practically all normal White people in the U . S . agree that the niggers do not fit into our society Most are aware of the facts of life — that niggers cause 85 percent of all crimes of violence — despite the fact that they reputedly only constitute 12 percent of the population ; that most of the welfare money is going to niggers , that welfare is becoming an ever-increasingly expensive burden , taking increasingly greater amounts of our earnings each year ; that the inner core of practically all the large cities in the U . S . are rotting from the effects of the nigger problem ; that school busing and mongrelization are a frightening evil caused by the niggers in our midst Most normal White Americans are aware of these facts , and with the exception of the idiotic hypocrites in our midst , the average American is well aware that our racial policy is going to destroy our country , our race and our nation Nevertheless , the idea of taking 30 million niggers and transporting them back across the ocean to the continent from which their ancestors were torn , seems somewhat staggering to them Again , this is so because the Jews have implanted these negative ideas in their minds However , when we consider this on the basis of economics and racial logic , it is the best bargain we could possibly buy for ourselves , if we did ship them over to Africa as quickly as possible ""Let's look at the figures If we assume that we were to ship every one of the 30 million blacks back to Africa , and even sent them over in style at a cost of $ 1,000 per head , the total sum would come to only $ 30 billion , a fraction of the total U . S . national budget for only one year And this would only be a one-time expense How can we afford it For one thing , we could take all the money now being wasted on foreign aid to countries which hate and despise us , and spend it on transporting American niggers back to Africa We could take all the money that we are now wasting on breeding and proliferating niggers in this country today , niggers that are polluting our Race with the black blood of Africa , and use that money to ship these same niggers back to Africa When you think of all the increasing billions and billions that are being spent on hundreds of idiotic welfare programs to breed and proliferate blacks , money being spent on foreign aid , money being spent on armaments that are not really defending us at all , and all the rest of the $ 200,000 , 000,000 a year ( plus ) budget , that for the largest part is being entirely wasted , and being appropriated by the Jews , we come to the conclusion that the question has been entirely misstated It should be : How can we afford to keep the niggers here How can we afford to keep coming up with billions and billions for one black hand-out program after another , year after year after year , with no end in sight With all the billions now being poured out for black welfare , black crime , black "" capitalism , "" and black slum programs , we could have shipped this alien black population back to Africa dozens of times over As to part ( b ) , that the American people will never do it — this becomes the more difficult part of the program It is here that we need an intensive program of re-educating , not so much the blacks , but re-educating the Whites It is entirely a matter of willpower Again , it is a matter of straightening out the White man's thinking If we have the will to live , the will to survive , we must and shall have the will to reject and to repel the pollution and proliferation of the black blood from our national White body When we look at recent history , we find that the Jews had no particular compunction about driving fourteen million Germans from their native soil in Prussia and East Germany , land they had occupied for the last several thousand years , and driving them westward Nor did the Jews feel particularly conscience-stricken when they drove one and a half million Arabs from their native lands in Palestine and appropriated all their farms and property and left the Arabs to starve out in the hot , dry desert Why should we Americans , who evidently had no compunction about killing millions of our White Brothers in Germany during World Wars I and II ; of bombing Hamburg and killing 50,000 men women and children in one night ; of fire-bombing Dresden and killing 300,000 of our White brethren there ; why should we suddenly be struck dumb with tenderness when it comes to dealing with the nigger problem Certainly the niggers are a real and present threat to our survival , which the Germans are not , and never were In fact , approximately 30 percent of all White Americans have German blood in their veins and it was , of course , one of the great travesties of history that we should have ever taken up arms against the courageous Germans , a people who were fighting OUR battle against the Jews for us and all White mankind We are only quoting history to show that the problem of shipping the niggers back to Africa is neither an economic problem , nor really a problem of morals , but purely a problem of racial attitude Once we get our thinking straight , the problem of shipping the niggers back to Africa is as good as solved When we think of how many niggers we could ship over there by employing a fleet of 747 ' s , or even as in wartime , using Liberty Ships , which we built in short order , it can readily be seen that the economic and physical problem is no problem at all We can do it , we must do it We can't afford not to I repeat , the real problem is to get our thinking straightened out , and that is what this book and the Creativity religion is all about And the key to straightening out the White Man's thinking is propaganda and enlightenment , organization , and more propaganda Remember , organized and united , the White Race is ten times as powerful as all the other races combined It is towards achieving this exalted and lofty goal that this book is dedicated It is the predominant aim of our new religion to achieve this magnificent goal "
1,"The Way Ahead : DEMOCRACY BRINGS THE POLICE STATE "" Democracy "" has been made at the close of the Twentieth Century the great political key-word , the supreme criterion of life : something sacrosanct , standing unquestionably for the highest form of government , the best type of society and the finest way of life This is so much so that acceptance has been made compulsory in the Britain of the 1990s by virtue of the special protection now accorded to Democracy by the secret police here which now formally treats rejection of Democracy as "" subversion "" Time was when national security was viewed simply as a matter of protection from a foreign foe intent on depriving us of ownership of our land and control of our affairs Now , in addition , one particular form of government and that alone is allowed to us , and any and every effort to replace it is classed as subversive and accordingly prohibited Now because of the development of Democracy as dictatorship in disguise , what is called "" national security "" ironically aids alien intrusion from both within and without This enforcement of creed under a fraudulent flag of liberty was unequivocally , unashamedly and publicly enunciated by secret police chief Stella Rimington , Director General of Military Intelligence 5 , otherwise known as the "" Security Service "" , on 24 June 1994 on BBC Television Channel One in her "" Richard Dimbleby Lecture 1994 "" There and then she declared : "" The intention to undermine democracy is what ' subversion ' means to us . To this avowed definition of purpose she added in accounting for the apportionment of MI5 time : "" Some of that is now devoted to groups on the extreme right who are seeking to undermine democracy through the exploitation of racial hatred and xenophobia . In the Rimington vocabulary "" racial hatred "" of course encompasses anything which gives recognition to the determinative factor of race as distinguishing native Britons from others who have come here ; and "" extreme right "" encompasses all who are "" extreme "" enough to perceive and attach importance to this racial factor , and want to do something in keeping with it "" Racial hatred "" indeed for her covers anything and everything critical and disrespectful to Democracy's "" Chosen Ones "" , the Jews , and thus includes for instance any accusation of cruelty laid against the Jewish ritual slaughter of animals for food , whereby they are bled to death without pre-stunning to prevent suffering , as required of gentiles , apart from Muslims who are similarly granted privileged exemption from the law affecting us Much of the meat resulting from Jewish ritual slaughter ends up being consumed by Aryans without them being aware that they have been made a party to this abominable Jewish practice because the fastidious Jews will not eat the rear part of the animals they slaughter The legislative basis for the special protection of Democracy as a matter of national security was laid down in 1989 by the Security Service Act , Clause 1 ( 2 ) , which placed "" actions intended to overthrow or undermine parliamentary democracy by political , industrial or violent means "" on a par with "" threats of espionage , terrorism and sabotage , from the activities of foreign powers "" This means that even entirely non-violent political canvassing of the public in favour of some other form of government , one truly representative of the authentic British people and their genuine interests , and conducive to their proper freedom , is deemed subversive by the real rulers of Democracy Working with MI5 as other parts of the apparatus of suppression of opposition to the disastrous Democratic system , we have firstly the "" Special Branch "" of the Police , concerned with political activities , and coming under the Metropolitan Commissioner of Police The present holder of this office is a Paul Condon who , in a conference lecture at the outset of his tenure , pinpointed "" racism "" as a prime concern on a par with the worst of crime , being a rejection of the essential multiracialism of Democracy ( Independent 1 March 1993 ) Secondly : we have GCHQ , the Government Communications Headquarters at Cheltenham , which monitors all radio , telex and telegraph communications into and out of Britain Thirdly , constant co-operation is provided by Democratic America's National Security Agency's surveillance installation on British soil at Menwith Hill just a few miles from me near Harrogate in Yorkshire which can listen in on telephone conversations all over Europe by interception of the broadband microwave network over which long-distance telephone communications travel ( See "" The Puzzle Palace "" , James Bamford ; Sidgwick & Jackson , London , 1983 ) DEMOCRACY IS WHAT DEMOCRACY DOES Democracy claims descent from Ancient Greece whence the word originated , but the truth is that what exists today in its name bears no solid resemblance to its alleged prototype The democracy of the days of Plato and Aristotle was a form of government confined to a particular town and surrounding area which constituted a state , and was therefore of the nature of local government with the area and the people so comparatively small as to allow immediate and personal contact between the government and its affairs and the governed The direct participation of the people was thus a reality in the Greek city-state where the people were , moreover , an ethnic community so that citizenship was a matter of kinship What is called "" Democracy "" today stands in stark contrast as a matter of huge units of assorted population nominally represented by members of parties which actually represent particular assortments of interests , the dominant array of which , through a mind-moulding media , particularly television , injects into the public desirable influencing material for the mind-set in view , and excludes what is deemed undesirable in influence for that mind-set In the outcome of this mind-moulding the conditioned public then votes between one or the other variation of the Democratic creed concerning which all the approved parties form a consensus Performing thus , like Pavlov's dogs with their conditioned reflexes , the public fondly imagines that it does the deciding , whereas it merely registers choice within the latitude allowed by the real rulers who are clandestine dictators Democracy is thus the colossal confidence trick of the century Furthermore , Democracy which is counterfeit at the core , has been embellished by its manipulators into something far more than just a method of government in order to provide maximum power , profit and protection for those manipulators It has in interpretation been turned into a whole creed concerned with a multiracial , egalitarian society What it does , more than what in some respects it claims to stand for , provides the most accurate definition of the Democracy afflicting us The results of Democracy in Britain today are a teaching profession and educational system which turns out a brainwashed , anarchic , egocentric , ideal lacking , crudely materialist , drug-taking younger generation addicted to a typifying din of decadence known as "" pop "" Adults are taken care of to similar effect by the mind controlling media , acting in conjunction with the propaganda and practices of the Democratic political parties The overall effect of this , in a crime-ravaged , run down vestige of a former world power and vast empire , is a British public which offers no effective resistance to being intruded on and ousted by hordes of Afro-Asians ; subjected to an ever extending alien control of British affairs from within and without ; and restricted by more and more measures to prevent and penalize opposition to this alienation of their homeland THE COLOURED INVASION The primary issue of preserving the British people as an ethnic community in ownership of its homeland , and therefore stopping and reversing the Coloured Invasion of Britain which has been allowed by the rulers of Democracy ever since the end of the Second World War , supposedly fought to keep Britain for the British , is one on which the wish of the indigenous population has never been the determinant The British people undoubtedly did not want the Coloured Invasion , but they certainly got it , precisely because Democracy , as the will of the people , is a sham In consequence of this invasion by dictation , we now learn from a headline in the Daily Telegraph ( 20 January 1994 ) , reporting a detailed study of ethnic data from the U . K . 1991 Census , that the "" Number of Blacks and Asians ' will double in 40 years ' . Another headline in the same newspaper a short time previous ( 2 December 1993 ) had recorded "" Europe's birthrate plunges to record low "" Taking these two items together , it is only a matter of time , and not much time at that , before thanks to Democracy the British become a minority in what was once their homeland An account sheet of all the costs of the Coloured Invasion in its every aspect and detail , including a reckoning for all the catastrophic consequences of miscegenation and out breeding and this as just one part of the total harm of Democracy – would make a gigantic condemnation of the political system responsible for it This colossal bill should be drawn up in full , put before the British public who have to pay it , and thrust in the face of the treacherous scoundrels at Westminster and Whitehall and elsewhere who are to blame for this looting of our resources , squandering of our heritage , and despoliation of our future To suppress opposition to this Coloured Invasion our freedom is being more and more taken away from us by more and more legislative and executive measures against what is indiscriminately and collectively called "" racial hatred "" , while continual demands resound for more severe enforcement of existing law , and the introduction of additional laws against it Hardly a week goes past without the Jewish community's main organ , the Jewish Chronicle , recording yet another round of lobbying by this minority to put pressure on the Government to impose further restriction on the native majority The Minister responsible , as Home Secretary , for keeping the public in order is currently Michael Howard , identified as a Jew by the Jewish Chronicle and thus to be regarded as an illegal immigrant in view of the unrevoked law of expulsion of 1290 Under Howard , as he calls himself now , although his original family surname was undoubtedly different , comes both MI5 and the Special Branch political police commanded by Metropolitan Police Commissioner Paul Condon The latter luminary of Democracy has identified "" racism "" as "" the greatest challenge "" for the police today , denouncing "" The dire consequences of racially based nationalism "" enjoining his officers to be "" totally intolerant "" of those who for political ends cause "" racial hatred "" ( Independent 1 March 1993 ) Behind Home Secretary Howard there is in the network of enforcement , in addition to MI5 and the Special Branch , a judiciary now headed by Lord Chief Justice Taylor ( also identified by the Jewish Chronicle as a Jew , whose original family surname is also at present unknown to me ) , and a Crown Prosecution Service plentifully staffed with his kind of people , as is the whole legal profession COMMUNISM COMES TO BRITAIN Full understanding of the nature and purpose of Democracy requires a perception of its inherent proclivity to become a fancy equation for Communism Jewish High Finance houses in the Democratic U . S . A . subsidized the initial establishment of Communism in Russia The Communist regimes there and elsewhere claimed to be and styled themselves new and fuller forms of Democracy In this guise they proceeded to conduct a mass extermination of opponents the scale of which vastly exceeded all the Jewish allegations against Germany Recent Russian estimates of those killed or brought to death by Communism in Russia alone range between 30 and 80 million Churchill and Roosevelt linked arms with the Red mass murderers in a war for Democracy , Communist and Capitalist style combined , against the cause of racial freedom and resurgence represented by National-Socialist Germany Under Churchill just under 2,000 British citizens , targeted by the secret police of MI5 and Special Branch because of opposition to the war , were seized and held in prison or concentration camp under Regulation 18B without trial ( See "" In the Highest Degree Odious "" , A . W Brian Simpson , Clarendon Press , 1992 ) The Red Holocaust must be loudly exposed whenever the word "" holocaust "" is raised by the Jews and their supporters which is more or less all the time Their latest star-studded replenishment of propaganda is the absurdly sensational , fictional film "" Schindler's List "" based on a book which itself stated it was fiction , and made by a Jewish maker of fantasy movies , Steven Spielberg Let us stand for free speech and full enquiry on all alleged atrocities including the Jewish "" holocaust "" and Allied war crimes Suddenly , several years ago , Communism seemed to vanish from Russia and Eastern Europe to great acclaim in the Western Democracies followed by a pay-off in massive aid , the U . S . A . announcing at the beginning of April 1993 a $ 1.6 billion package of short-term aid to its accredited protege , President Boris Yeltsin , as the first down payment to help his brand of Democracy survive Quite soon after this foreign financing of Russian Democracy started , Democratic dictator Yeltsin proceeded to ride roughshod over the Russian parliament , arbitrarily dissolving it , and , when the parliamentarians resisted , sending troops to attack the parliament building and kill many inside ; all this with the sympathetic understanding of the Western upholders of Russian Democracy Money and materials have not been the only form of aid to help set up in Russia the system and society we are afflicted with here Our secret police chief Stella Rimington has admitted in her lecture to which we have already referred that Britain's secret police have been working with that of Democratic dictator Yeltsin to further the imposition of Democracy in his country Said the lady : "" Together with our sister service SIS , we provided advice and support for the reorganised and reoriented security services , particularly to help them establish a democratic framework for their work "" ( SIS = "" Secret Intelligence Service "" or MI6 , coming under the Foreign Secretary ) So has Communism really gone , or only done a conjuror's vanishing trick on the world stage in order more conveniently and effectively to operate in times now and ahead Has it been decided that the time is now ripe for it to proceed and succeed better in seeming disjoined and piecemeal fashion under a different name , disguised as "" Democracy "" : the slower but no less sure vehicle to the same destination Well the fact is that , in the slower and surreptitious form , we have got it right here in Britain today in our schools staffed with those who are Lefties , either formally or virtually , with all their indoctrination of our children with multiracial , anti-patriotic , anti-authoritarian , super-egalitarian notions Communism is here in substance in the dictatorship of the media with its constant conveyance of material destructive of traditional values , and expression of the crass materialism of a nomadic , global , consumer society which extols the emancipation of the common man and the will of the majority in theory while ensuring his plutocratic exploitation in practice Communism is here today in all the reaches of that regimentation of thought known as "" political correctness "" , and in the suppression of racial patriotism by means of "" racial hatred "" law and a secret security service and a political police Apropos this communistic law , let it be remembered that "" anti-semitism "" was made a crime within a few months of the Communist Revolution in Russia in 1917 , just as it is being made a crime in the Britain of Democracy today Some 50 years ago the advocates of world government were striving to get acceptance for it in its entirety at one go They failed , but they learned by their failure , and they took to bringing it about bit by bit without an off putting name , and without attracting attention to the ultimate aggregation ; and now they are succeeding The Communists have learned the same lesson , and are now following the same methods leading to the same ultimate aggregation in view "" Communism "" and "" Democracy "" are interchangeable titles for basically and mostly the same thing "" a Great Pretence under which in the first case a dictatorship of the proletariat "" pretends to represent the people in a "" classless society "" of the exploited and enslaved masses ; and in the second case another oligarchy , a dictatorship of the media , big business and finance , exercises its power and reaps its profit behind a facade of representation of the people in a society which is uniform or classless in the liberty to conform , which is the compulsion to do so DEMOCRACY IS DEATH Democracy , as Britain's pioneer National-Socialist Arnold Leese proclaimed , is death Its synthesis of Communism and Capitalism , distinguished by a fusion of deceit , deprivation and degeneration , is sure to bring about the diminution of the White folk of this country and the world at large to the point of virtual extinction within the coming century through the rapid proliferation of the Coloured peoples and the ever increasing ratio of half-breeds resulting from stimulated miscegenation which Democracy by its very nature engenders The Jews , however , who are predominantly non-European racially , will undoubtedly not only survive but surmount and hold sway by means of the religious racialism which so powerfully permeates them and is so zealously practised by them In this dire situation the one and only way to future life for the White peoples of the world lies in overthrowing the death-system of Democracy , and replacing it with a life-system devoted to the preservation , improvement and proliferation of White or Aryan stock The name of this life-system is National-Socialism The question is : can it be done To attempt to answer this most fateful question we have to shed all illusions , all wishful thinking , conjured up to lessen apprehension and to generate optimism We have to face up fully to the gravity of the menace , the consequent immensity of the task , the slightness of the chance of success which is dwindling daily as the enemy extends and consolidates its power ; and we have frankly to admit the impotence of our side The thorough and realistic appraisal which is required can only lead to the terrible truth that our side is getting nowhere fast , and that if it continues in its present ways it is doomed to certain failure Its time and effort will continue to be wasted until the last chance has gone , and the everlasting darkness descends That is my conclusion Yet it is one to which I immediately add another which is that this certain defeat under present circumstances , since it will be decided by the accumulated consequences of wrong thinking and wrong practice , can even now be avoided This can be done if , firstly , we are resolved to make the effort to subject all present attitudes and practices to the most searching and severe examination , scrutinizing without inhibition and reservation all habitual routine which can so very easily become rigidly restrictive habit , precluding awareness and admission of fault Secondly , having performed this rigorous survey as our initial achievement , we have as our second achievement to gain the liberating benefit of the lessons discerned by making the effort , however exacting , to rid ourselves of the wrong thinking and wrong practice detected , and to introduce and unswervingly follow what has been seen to be essential We can win , and I think I can tell you how to do so , but whether you will win that I cannot say for it depends on you What I will here now seek to do is to set down what I regard as the three primary requirements for victory , and then proceed to unfold them They are : The right ideology – which has to be world-wide and life-wide ; a Weltanschauung of religious significance and force The right people – who have to be people adhering to this Weltanschauung in heart and mind , conforming to it in personal conduct , and zealously implementing it in every possible way The right forms of organization enabling the right people with the right ideology to work and fight to maximum effect REJECTION OF DEMOCRACY Accepting the three requirements for victory calls for a clear perception of and complete rejection of the enemy The enemy , collectively , is a whole way of thinking and behaving ; a whole political system and society incorporating this thought and behaviour ; and a whole array of persons effectively responsible for promoting this thought and behaviour , and this system and society of Democracy It has to be seen that Democracy is at war with us on all the fronts of life , and that our response therefore has to be a counterattack on all those fronts of life and nothing less Ousting Democracy begins with thoroughly ousting it from you , your outlook , your habits , and your daily life as far as possible Democracy has to be recognized and denounced as the creed and system of death which it is Let there be no hesitation , no diffidence about this : no feeble fudging to try and make out that you are just another and better Democrat through intricate contortions to dissemble anti-Democracy as its opposite You cannot set about distributing the elixir of life by peddling more of the old poison To squirm to evade forthright denunciation is a fatal exhibition of inner failure at the outset , a lethal lack of the will to win ; whereas the purging act of repudiation is a demonstration of that will , without which nothing is possible and with which everything is Rejecting the death-system of Democracy as the prerequisite for the salvation of the Aryan folk requires the clearest and fiercest indictment of those principally responsible for its operation here and throughout the world This partly but particularly means the politicians past and present of the Democratic parties , including those of Britain , these latter having to be seen and unreservedly and constantly referred to as the greatest criminals in our land and history Theirs has been the supreme crime of betraying our folk by their policies and practices , and in particular by opening our doors to mass Afro-Asian and Jewish immigration , and coercing our folk to accept this immigration and to integrate with the immigrants ; and opening our affairs to alien influence and control from both inside and outside The rejection of Democracy is necessarily , as the other side of the coin , the acceptance of its only complete replacement which is National-Socialism : the creed composed by Adolf Hitler and his colleagues , drawing on antecedent elements , and bequeathed by them to us to extend to suit contemporary conditions by any legitimate development of its implications , or adoption of secondary details of implementation , consonant with the principles of the creed In contrast no mere patchwork of oddments of reform , composed as some compromise between what is really needed and what presently prevails , and conceived to suit the present state of the public mind besotted with the infusions of the enemy media , is worth ten seconds consideration Only a revolutionary creed with the necessary profundity and amplitude and dynamic strength to meet and match and remedy the emergency Democracy confronts us with deserves our attention All else is utterly inadequate , and the wishy-washy presenters of these supposed short cuts by way of Democratic acceptability are just pathetic , time-wasting distractors NATIONAL-SOCIALISM NOT FASCISM National-Socialism , as the right ideology and only remedy , has to be carefully differentiated from Fascism with which it is commonly and conveniently lumped by opponents , and carelessly confused by adherents The former is founded on and inseparable from the conception of the folk or racial community This determines the nation , and this delineates its citizenship With National-Socialism , as Arnold Leese put it , "" Race is the basis of politics "" It inescapably follows from this that National-Socialism , properly understood in its inevitable implications , is not and cannot be simply a conventional nationalism , even one based on a proclaimed racial identity , albeit one geographically circumscribed and confined Racial characteristics , whatever the particular blend within a particular country , transcend the boundary of that country , and thus potentially unite where the barriers of conventional nationalism divide The Aryans of this earth have been brought to their present appalling plight by way of the divisive wars of conventional nationalism with non-Aryans fostering and profiting by the friction The creed of salvation must thus be one of pan-Aryan racialism Fascism , despite merits , is not founded on Race , and is not pan-Aryan Instead it is only a reformed and revitalized nationalism for the old , geographical , national state This is why Mussolini in his early days of power , before the influence of Germany as an ally was felt , had Jewish colleagues , and the Fascist Week in the U . K . ( 27 April – 3 May 1934 ) included a report that "" The Chief Rabbi ( of Italy ) was a Fascist , and was a strong supporter of Mussolini . It is why his granddaughter , Alessandra Mussolini – standing as a candidate for the modified version of the MSI in the March 1994 elections , and obtaining 50.4 % of the vote in the racial rubbish heap of Naples – happily played the part of a Jewess in a 1989 film , and dismisses anti-Jewish opinion as "" old hat "" ( Sunday Telegraph 5 December 1993 ) Based on recognition of Race , and with this being not only the recognition of and zeal to preserve the racial identity of the Aryan folk as distinct from other folk , but recognition also of qualitative differences within the folk itself , and the need therefore to improve the breed as the most effective way to produce a better society ; National-Socialism applies this racial outlook to all aspects of government and all else of life in a totality of comprehension It derives an ardour for economic and social justice from the notion of kinship ; an adhesion to leadership within a hierarchy of talent and responsibility from an appreciation of the workings of Nature conducive to the ascendancy of the superior ; and from this oneness with Nature a desire to conserve by organic management the resources of this planet WITH HITLER TO VICTORY In embracing National-Socialism to its full extent as the needed ideology for victory , there can be no question of failing for any reason of crippling timidity or myopia to give rightful recognition to Adolf Hitler as the great personification of this creed To attempt to present it without this recognition of its founder , prophet and leader is the equivalent of seeking to propagate Christianity a spiritual underpin of Democracy without mentioning Christ To say this is not to attempt to deify Hitler , and at the cost of depreciating the contribution made by his followers in those days which was gigantic , or the contribution that will have to be made by his followers now and in the future if victory is to be secured , which will have to be even more gigantic The necessity to give homage to Adolf Hitler as towering genius , superman of our cause , is not simply a matter of justice in fair acknowledgement , or even the test of sincerity and strength involved in making this acknowledgement , but of the immense advantage thereby to be gained , contrary to the lament of feeble nationalists and "" patriots "" that association with Hitler and National-Socialism is a ruinous disability which can and must be avoided These trembling warriors are forever in full flight from their own shadows , seemingly unable to comprehend that their complaints against the system point towards , and will certainly be portrayed by the astute enemy as pointing towards Hitler and National-Socialism , and the more they protest at this conclusion the more the enemy will know that they can be put to flight by raising it Thus these political eunuchs are powerless from the start , while ludicrously congratulating themselves on a "" wisdom "" which is in fact an imperviousness to the real thing We National-Socialists , unlike these people with their flaccid messages of hotchpotch programmes to repair the Democratic system in a Democratic way , have not only a whole Weltanschauung , but within it a well of great depth of inspiration provided by the example of the tremendous devotion , the enormous hard work , the glorious heroism and colossal achievements of National-Socialist Germany under Adolf Hitler Far from this wonderful and unique heritage of ours being some fatal drawback as the vendors of nostrums acceptable as conformable to Democracy aver , it is our exclusive strength : the sustenance of and for giants in the gigantic struggle facing us The argument that the general public will not , now , accept National-Socialism and its pivotal figure of Adolf Hitler is meaningless in the context that general publics never make or break revolutions , and soliciting their participation is a futile deviation , not the proper way to salvation That general public will remain in bondage to the almighty enemy media and the real rulers of Democracy until the Democratic system is brought to its breakdown Then and only then will our breakthrough become possible Then the general public will have become sufficiently sick and tired of Democracy to become sufficiently receptive to what we have to say With the acquisition then of state power , and a media of liberation in place of one of bondage , we will be able to bring the mind of that public to acceptance of and thereby the necessary willing support for the measures of revolutionary transformation of society Having identified in outline the first requirement for victory over Democracy , namely the ideology of National-Socialism , we will return to this subject in further detail at a later point , meanwhile passing on to consider the second requirement : the right people THE PEOPLE WE NEED The best of ideas must fail to come to fruition unless their bearers are worthy of those ideas For the gigantic task of overthrowing the death-system of Democracy we do not need , and must not aim at , and instead must eschew striving for some big collection of all and sundry types of human being of greatly varying value ranging from the vast majority who are mediocre at the very best , willing for and capable of giving only a little service at the most and taking only a little risk , if any , to the few who are of high worth : being of the calibre of constant and invincible believers , regular hard-workers , and courageous fighters It is only the last-mentioned who are fit for and needed for the vanguard for victory , the assembly of the elite Confusion with and attachment to the rest , it must be emphasized to the utmost , is not as current wrong thought and practice has it some desirable aggregation whereby the little bits from the little people all helps To the contrary , the little people with their little bits are in such a combination infinitely more harm than help , hobbling the elite on which ultimately all depends They belong in the background as sympathizers and auxiliaries , and must be ruthlessly relegated to this position We cannot afford to clutter up and cripple our fighting force with an out-numbering and impeding array of camp followers The way to victory is to be found in the triumph of quality , and not in the indiscriminate pursuit and use of quantity Democracy , all-powerful as it may well now appear in the strength of the minority who rule by means of it and the prevalence of the ideas which that minority spreads , is really a leviathan with feet of clay in that it is vulnerable to the extent of its reliance on an infrastructure of increasing complexity manned by people who are largely ordinary in their lack of dedication , stamina and courage ; and in its commitment to policies which inherently involve great strain and stress Our superior few , the supermen and superwomen , can because of this succeed against the rulers of Democracy The ultimate battle to decide the fate of our race and nation will be between two political minorities : that of the enemy wielding power over the state , and that of ours working and fighting to seize that state power It is a battle we can win if and only if we produce as our minority an elite more powerful to disrupt Democracy than their minority with its lesser quality and its entanglement with inferior supporting personnel is to defend it We can only do this if we avoid an entanglement of our elite with a mass of people of lesser quality Numbers will not decide our future in our favour Quality , the efficacy of a superlative elite , can do so Stop to imagine and fully appreciate the fighting strength , the capacity to strike and damage , which belongs to the superman or woman , meaning the person afire with devotion to the cause felt in religious dimension as the supreme motivation of his or her life ; the person who educates himself or herself to the highest degree in his or her beliefs and their application ; the person who invariably puts principles into practice , living his or her beliefs as a daily way of life ; the person who systematically trains himself or herself to be in one specialist capacity or another a most effective instrument for the revolutionary pursuit of those beliefs The combination thus in one and the same person of thinker , zealot , worker , warrior makes an unbeatable coalescence of human qualities , an unequaled unit for revolutionary action which Democracy can never match or withstand This is our special weapon which can compensate for all other deficiencies With but a few dozen of these supermen and women great havoc can be wrought upon the enemy With hundreds of them Democracy will be in deadly danger , and victory will be in sight The vital spark , becoming the flame of victory energizing the vanguard of victory , is the will to win in the minds of the National-Socialist elite We can succeed and we must succeed , but the measure of our right to succeed and the sign that we will succeed lies in the inflexible determination to fight : to fight on regardless of the immediacy or even the certainty or even the likelihood of attaining state power This is because the 100 % National-Socialist fights for National-Socialism as nothing less than a necessity of being , and not because of any assessment of chances of success Doing so , he knows that a victory of the spirit is always won , whatever else happens Indeed , the lesser the possibility of physical victory over the hostile state , the greater the honour and the greater the moral victory of doing so STARTING THE REVOLUTION IN YOU So the people we need are those with the will to win With it they are on the threshold of the very first phase of the National-Socialist Revolution This is an internal revolution : a seizure of power within themselves The other phases are , secondly , the attainment and exercise of forms of power short of state power ; thirdly , the attainment of state power ; and fourthly , the exercise of state power to bring the people to adopt the desired new ways of living The "" Vanguard "" is my term for the National-Socialist elite intent on accomplishing the fourfold course of the National-Socialist Revolution No one becomes a member of the Vanguard simply by completing some piece of paper and paying some subscription as happens with the numbers game of the old organizations One only becomes part of it in name by virtue of becoming part of it in thought and action Given the will to win , you start the revolution – in you – by renouncing allegiance to the Democratic state which has no moral or other legitimate claim to your allegiance and obedience , and thus exerts only a wrongful compulsion by brute force Our supreme law lies not in the decrees of Democracy in pursuit of its foul purposes against our folk , but instead in the high ordinances implied in the vital requirements for the protection and welfare of that folk This understanding initiates the whole salutary process of evicting the enemy from the moral high ground it has usurped , and relegating it to the depths as vile and vicious , perverted and hateful The above renunciation as an expression of the will to win should mean an end to being hesitant , diffident and defensive about your beliefs Henceforth you have to be on the offensive No more , for example , can it be permissible to fight shy of the label "" racialist "" , trying to talk around and away from this loaded hate-word of the enemy Yes , yes you are indeed a racialist as a defender of our race from ruin , and proud to say so The Vanguard member on the attack with the will to win needs to be a fit person in all respects , physically , mentally and spiritually He or she needs to respect Nature in the temple of the body as just as much a matter of National-Socialism as anything else , exercising adequately , and acquainting himself or herself with the requirements of a good diet , because what we eat becomes what we are While it is all right for the supporters of Democracy to stuff their stomachs with such as puffed-up potato crisps , chemically doctored "" soft drinks "" , nutritionally-deprived white flour , fat-soaked fish and chips , excessive salt and sugar , debilitated and adulterated "" convenience foods "" and suspect or definitely harmful additives galore , not forgetting that manna of modernity in the form of McDonald's reconstructed beefburgers ; our pioneers of a better world have to practise a better form of feeding The personal revolution is no mere matter of continually saying you are against the system of Democracy , and meaning it – up to a point – but at that point unthinkingly retaining its habits and appearances in your own daily life You have to cast off its conventions of speech such as the terrible "" t "" of "" tolerance "" , meaning tolerance of what is detrimental to the survival and welfare of our folk You have to cast off its garb too , meaning in particular the slovenly jeans and sloppy footwear which are Democracy's authentic uniform for its disorderly "" casual "" cosmopolitan citizen With the will to win fully applied in your personal life , so that you are waging the first phase of the revolution , each morning should start with the vow to find in the following twenty-four hours good ways of effectively fighting the multiracial abomination of Democracy You only live once , so give meaning to your life by fighting the good fight throughout The Vanguard member pursues an ongoing course of study and training to make him or her a more and more efficient instrument of revolution At the end of this primer a list of recommended general reading will be provided as a beginning for study Further reading should include books dealing with whatever field of action the particular member feels most interested in and suitable for We have to be professionals in the business of revolution , thereby quality more than makes up for lack of numbers and other resources Every form of activity has to be seen as falling within an art or a science to be methodically pursued by study and training , rehearsal , critical review of that rehearsal , yet more study and training to remedy shortcomings shown by the rehearsal ; and thus to reach the pitch of achieving maximum effect for minimum time and effort and minimum risk The Vanguard member is the person capable of converting by personal example meaning personal appearance and behaviour You have won the first battle in the field of conversion when clean , tidy and courteous , you have made an attractive personal impression Thus qualified , you can go about your life with your eyes open for others suitable to be brought into the fold , always understanding that any and every approach must involve watching the prospect for an adequate length of time to be reasonably sure that you have someone of the right type : genuine and reliable and capable It is far better to take time to make sure than later to regret it Young people particularly are needed because of the vigour of youth , and also because they tend not to have become materially tied to the existing order as older people with their established commitments and concern for their accumulated resources tend to be Women must not be neglected or cast in some inferior role as is the bad habit of the old organizations Democracy , as one of its deceits , acutely degrades women in its pretence of emancipating them ; whereas National-Socialism elevates them by honouring their natural role and ensuring for them the freedom to fulfil it It is imperative that a Vanguard member only takes or retains as spouse someone who , if not also a Vanguard member , is at least dependably sympathetic to National-Socialism and , moreover , to involvement in the Vanguard You cannot afford to have to face friction in the home over Vanguard involvement , along with all other problems of the struggle In the German struggle for power women played a great part Front rows at meetings addressed by Adolf Hitler were packed with intensely enthusiastic members of the fair sex In the desperate later days of the war "" Great numbers of them had written to Hitler and Goebbels demanding the right to fight "" A women's force , Adolf Hitler , was formed in March 1945 , but too late ( "" Reich "" , James Lucas , Grafton Books , London , 1990 ; P . 134 ) Let us not be too late in bringing women into the fight The deed speaks loudest , and the great deed obliges everyone to listen In the final analysis a creed only proves its significance for life if adherents are prepared to give up liberty and even life itself for it In the Hitler era huge numbers of adherents were prepared to do exactly that Post-war National-Socialism is so far comparatively short of new heroes We have a few martyrs abroad : men who have undergone or are undergoing long periods of imprisonment , and who have remained undaunted in spirit These wonderful people deserve and must receive our commensurate respect and support Along with them we have as a glorious example of the political soldier the heroic leader of The Silent Brotherhood in the U . S .

1,"The Islamic State provides the Muslims with extensive healthcare by running a host of medical facilities including hospitals and clinics in all major cities through which it is offering a wide range of medical services , from various types of complicated surgery to simpler services such as hij āmah This infrastructure is aided by a widespread network of pharmacies run by qualified pharmacists and managed under the supervision and control of the Health Dīwān Just as the medical staff in the hospitals and clinics are made up of qualified , trained professionals , the pharmacies are likewise only run by qualified and certified pharmacists In order to ensure a steady supply of qualified medical personnel in the future as well as expanding and enhancing the current medical services from a professional as well as Islamic point of view , the Islamic State recently opened the Medical College in ar-Raqqah as well as the College for Medical Studies in Mosul To achieve the stated aims , a new 3 - year  6 - semester curriculum was developed by senior medical experts It consists of both intensive theoretical study in the first year with a gradual introduction to practical work under tutelage in the second and third years This new practice-oriented curriculum is in stark contrast to previous curriculums that would include tāghūt - sponsored pseudo-sciences such as "" culture "" ( i . e secular nationalism ) or superfluous subjects that are irrelevant to a physician's day-to-day work The new curriculum covers specialties such as general surgery , fracture and orthopedic surgery , trauma surgery , gynecology and obstetrics , cardiology , pediatric and medical emergency , ophthalmology , urinary surgery , neurosurgery , thoracic surgery and vascular surgery The teaching staff consists exclusively of degree holders Entrance is open to both females and males , with a dedicated school building , hospital , and female teaching staff for the female students To support the students in their efforts the Islamic State does not charge any fees and provides the students with all that is necessary in terms of food , clothing , housing , transport , and books For further encouragement high-achievers are granted rewards A senior medical worker in the Health Dīwān in ar-Raqqah explained to Dābiq that the Medical College attracted more than 300 applicants , of which 100 were accepted , half of whom were muh ājirīn He also mentioned that the student body is highly motivated and achieved good results in the first months , but that the staff wishes for support from additional teachers , preferably muh ājirīn with experience in the medical field He also indicated that a practical laboratory will soon be opened for the students This should be received as a wake-up call for the many Muslim students in the lands of kufr who claim to study medicine to "" benefit and support the Muslim Ummah , "" but then remain in those lands , chasing after worldly pleasures instead of performing hijrah to the Islamic State – and this despite hijrah being an undeniable Islamic obligation , in addition to the fact that hijrah was and still is relatively easy The Islamic State offers everything that you need to live and work here , so what are you waiting for "
1,"Following the crusader coalition's announcement that it had begun carrying out attacks on the lands of the Muslims , the Sahwah factions of riddah raced to offer their services to the crusaders and their regional puppets This included sending them information on the locations of the muj āhidīn in ' Ayn al-Isl ām , and likewise in Tall Mālid in the northern Halab countryside , thereby serving as the crusaders ' eyes on the ground This made the muj āhidīn all the more determined to pay them back for their treacherous legacy , which began long before the coalition even entered the picture The payback , as is often the case with the soldiers of the Islamic State , would be brutal and unexpected On the 18th of Jum ādā al - Ākhirah , two istishh ādiyyīn , Jarr āh ash-Sh āmī and Abū Bakr al-Kurd ī , carried out attacks on the Sahw āt in the northern Halab countryside , targeting important locations in Māri ' and in Huwar Killis , where they penetrated Sahwah positions belonging to the Shāmiyyah Front and wrought havoc in their midst These attacks occurred during a meeting of the Shāmiyyah Front with other factions – including the Jawl ānī front – to discuss expanding their war against the Islamic State The operations succeeded in killing more than 80 Sahwah members and wounding dozens more , with multiple Sahwah leaders amongst the casualties Shortly after , and possibly as a result of the many dead leaders , the Shāmiyyah Front began to break up , with some of its member factions leaving to form competing coalitions { You think they are together , but their hearts are diverse That is because they are a people who do not reason } [ Al-Hashr : 14 ] We ask Allah to accept our istishh ādī brothers amongst the shuhad ā ' "
1,"Last month , the soldiers of the Khil āfah succeeded in capturing the 4th Regiment base in Wil āyat Sham āl Baghdad The region in which the regiment base is located is considered very important as it connects together four wil āyāt It connects Sham āl Baghdad and Sal āhuddīn with al-Anb ār and al-Fall ūjah The victory dealt a severe blow to the Safaw ī army as the capture of the region meant that the Islamic State had now cut off the main Safaw ī supply route from Baghdad through al-Anb ār The operation to capture the regiment base had multiple phases , including reconnaissance using both aerial drones and ground units , which succeeded in identifying important targets both inside and outside the regiment base The operation itself began on Thursday , the 20th of Jum ādā al - Ākhirah , after Fajr prayer The soldiers of the Khil āfah prayed Fajr , placed their trust and hope in Allah , and made du ' ā ' asking Him for His support and victory and destroy the military intelligence officers ' building and ammunition storage center , which he successfully fulfilled The battle commenced with the muj āhidīn attacking the main gate in order to pave the way for the istishh ādī brothers to enter the base This was after distracting all of the lookout posts The gate was opened and the istishh ādī brother Abū Mus'ab al-Alm ānī entered the base driving an explosives-laden armored military vehicle carrying 7 tons of highly explosive substances His mission was to target and destroy the base's command center He entered and detonated his explosive vehicle , completely destroying the command center building A second istishh ādī brother , Abū Hamzah ash-Sh āmī , then entered with an explosives-laden and armor-plated water truck carrying 8 tons of explosives His mission was to target A third and final istishh ādī attack was carried out by brother Hamzah at-T ājīkī , who entered with an explosives-laden and armor-plated water truck carrying 8 tons of explosives His mission was to target and destroy the soldiers ' barracks He entered the base and detonated his vehicle , completing the istishh ādī phase of the assault The battle began after Fajr prayer and lasted until about half an hour after sunset , and although crusader-coalition warplanes were involved in the battle , they had no effect in stopping the muj āhidīn The battle ended with the regiment base completely destroyed , dozens of Safaw ī soldiers and officers killed , and 2 armored vehicles and 13 other various vehicles along with weapons and ammo being taken as ghan īmah A highlight of the battle for the 4th Regiment base was the attack carried out by the first istishh ādī brother , Abū Mus'ab al-Alm ānī , whose name would now be written – by Allah's permission – amongst those whose past had been tainted with Muslim blood , and would atone for it by embracing Islam and fighting for the cause of Allah until they were killed ""Allah's Messenger ( sallall āhu ' alayhi wa sallam ) said , "" Allah laughs at two men who both enter Jannah after one of them kills the other . He was asked , "" How , O Messenger of Allah ? He said , "" This one is killed , so he enters Jannah Then Allah turns to the other one in forgiveness by guiding him to Islam Then he fights for the cause of Allah and attains shah ādah "" [ Reported by al-Bukh ārī and Muslim ] Just a few years ago , Abū Mus'ab was serving in the German crusader army that was waging war against the Muslims in Afghanistan , and through His grace and favor , Allah chose to guide him , replace his evil with good , and make him a warrior spilling his blood for this noble cause { And Allah guides whom He wills to a straight path } [ Al-Baqarah : 213 ] May Allah accept all of our brothers who were killed in this battle amongst the shuhad ā ' "
1,"{ Indeed , those who disbelieve spend their wealth to avert [ people ] from the way of Allah So they will spend it ; then it will be for them a [ source of ] regret ; then they will be overcome } [ Al-Anf āl : 36 ] Despite forming a coalition of dozens of nations , allying with their longtime regional foe – Iran – whose militias refer to them as "" the Great Satan , "" conducting a relentless bombing campaign in Iraq and Shām , recruiting various Sahwah militias and Marxist Kurdish factions , and spending billions of dollars to wage media warfare , the crusaders could only watch helplessly as the Islamic State continued advancing in Iraq and Shām , expanding its territory both East and West In the East , the city of ar-Ram ādī – the capital of al-Anb ār – was liberated by the soldiers of the Khil āfah in what amounted to a repeat of the Safaw ī army's embarrassing retreat in Mosul The residents of the city watched , and even recorded video , as Safaw ī convoys drove past them fleeing from the muj āhidīn ' s advance This occurred after the muj āhidīn of the Khil āfah led a fierce campaign dubbed "" the Battle of Abū Muhannad as-Suwayd āwī "" during which they captured a number of key areas and facilities in and around the city , including the "" Anb ār Provincial Council "" building , the Anb ār police administration building , the Anb ār operations command center , the stadium area , the 8th Brigade base , and the "" counterterrorism "" administration , where they freed the Muslims imprisoned in the dungeons of the Safawiyy īn It was a hard-fought victory , but the muj āhidīn spent little time celebrating , choosing instead to pursue the fleeing Safaw ī soldiers and their Sahwah allies , to continue their march forward towards the neighboring regions , and to prepare for the next major battle The liberation of ar-Ram ādī happened together with a major advance in the West by the armies of the Khil āfah , who were leading a renewed offensive in Wil āyat Hims They liberated the city of as-Sukhnah and the nearby Naj īb gas company , and also took control of a large part of the city of Tadmur ( Palmyra ) They then captured the checkpoint guarding the al-Hayl gas field on the road between as-Sukhnah and Tadmur after which they managed to take control of a large part of the gas field itself and lay siege to Nusayr ī forces inside the Ārāk gas company Just days later , the muj āhidīn took control of the Ārāk gas company after killing at least 170 Nusayr ī soldiers during the course of four days of battles These successes were topped off by another major victory yesterday as the muj āhidīn went on to completely liberate the city of Tadmur The advances made by the Islamic State in al-Anb ār and Hims , by Allah's grace , demonstrate the muj āhidīn ' s resilience towards crusader coalition airstrikes , and their determination to punish the enemies of Allah wherever they find them no matter how many obstacles they must pass through to reach them – and this without the need to declare a "" storm of resolve . The crusaders heavily underestimated the firmness and strength of the muj āhidīn , and their plans – by Allah's permission – will soon crumble And all praise is due to Allah by whose blessing all good is achieved "
1,"On the 16th of Jum ādā al - Ūlā the muj āhid Shaykh Abū Bakr Shekau ( hafidhahull āh ) , leader of Jam ā ' at Ahlis-Sunnah lid-Da'wah wal-Jih ād in West Africa , announced his group's bay'ah to Amīrul - Mu'min īn Ibr āhīm Ibn ' Aww ād al-Qurash ī The bay'ah , which came on the heels of a widely successful campaign being waged by the muj āhidīn across Nigeria and into neighboring regions , was a tremendous cause of celebration for the Muslims and yet another source of gloom for the kuff ār The hearts of the Muslims were healed as they saw their brothers in West Africa terrorizing the Christians and the Nigerian army of murtadd īn , many of whom were forced to flee in disgrace and seek refuge in Chad The kāfir media , meanwhile , having anticipated the unity of the West African muj āhidīn with the Islamic State , lamented the fact that such a relentless and aggressive force with a considerable level of consolidation , had resolved to take up the banner of the Khil āfah in the war against the crusaders and apostates For years , the muj āhidīn of West Africa stood firm against the apostate and crusader forces who were attempting to wipe out any traces of Islam in the region They stood firm in the face of slander and opposition by the evil scholars and other hypocrites They stood firm when their leader , the muj āhid Shaykh Muhammad Yūsuf ( rahimahull āh ) , was executed by the apostate Nigerian police They did not fear the blame of any critics when they captured and enslaved hundreds of Christian girls , even as the crusader media machine put the brunt of its strength into focusing the world's attention on the issue They stood firm , so Allah increased their strength , hastened their victory , granted them consolidation , and humiliated their enemies { Is the reward for good [ anything ] but good ? [ Ar-Rahm ān : 60 ] And what was their response to the favors and blessings of Allah They showed their gratitude to Him through a deed even greater than those that they had already accomplished ; they closed ranks with their brothers in the Islamic State , uniting upon the truth , pledging to listen to and obey Amīrul - Mu'min īn and to continue upon the path to raise high the word of Allah Their bay'ah was acknowledged by the Islamic State , and the muj āhidīn of West Africa now guard yet another frontier of the Khil āfah The Islamic State's spokesman , Shaykh Abū Muhammad al-'Adn ānī ( hafidhahull āh ) , said , "" And we bring you the good news today of the Khil āfah ' s expansion to West Africa , for the Khal īfah ( hafidhahull āh ) has accepted the pledge of allegiance made by our brothers in Jam ā ' at Ahlis-Sunnah lid-Da'wah wal-Jih ād We congratulate the Muslims and our muj āhid brothers in West Africa on their pledge of allegiance , and we congratulate them on joining the caravan of the Khil āfah So rejoice , O Muslims , for this is a new door that Allah , the Mighty and Majestic , has opened so that you may migrate to the land of Islam and so that you may wage jih ād So whoever is stopped by the disbelieving rulers , and prevented from emigrating to Iraq , Shām , Yemen , the Arabian Peninsula , or Khur āsān , will not be prevented – by Allah's permission – from emigrating to Africa So come , O Muslims , to your State , for we call on you to mobilize for jih ād and incite you and invite you to emigrate to your brothers in West Africa And we specifically call upon the students of Islamic knowledge and the callers to Islam Come forth , O Muslims , to the land of the Caliphate "" [ So They Kill and Are Killed ] Following the announcement of the bay'ah , and its acceptance by the Islamic State , the Muslims in the various regions of the Khil āfah took to the streets in celebration , for nothing brings greater joy to the believers than to see their brothers unite with them under one banner and one imām , pledging to wage war against kufr until the religion is entirely for Allah The condition of the muj āhidīn in West Africa was a condition of unity upon tawh īd , which saw them rallying behind one leader from amongst them to wage war against kufr and implement the Shar ī ' ah in their land So when they saw the Muslims , and especially the muj āhidīn around the world , uniting behind the Khal īfah to raise high the word of Allah they did likewise , not for wealth , fame , or power , but for something much greater Echoing the words of the muj āhidīn of Libya , they said , "" We pledged allegiance because the goodness of this Ummah , concerning both its religious and worldly affairs , will not be achieved except with a leader who governs the people by Allah's law , forces the violators back to the truth , and wages war against those who are obstinately resistant and against those who obstruct the people from the religion of Allah This is the foundation of the religion – a book that guides and a sword that aids { And sufficient is your Lord as a guide and a helper } [ Al-Furq ān : 31 ] . The muj āhidīn in West Africa continue to wage jih ād against the enemies of Allah in a land that contains a large population of hostile crusaders The Christian masses in Nigeria , mostly contained in the southern portion of the country and comprising less than half of the population , have not shied away from massacring the Muslims of West Africa Despite crusader hostility , however , the muj āhidīn carried the banner of tawh īd , calling to the truth , clashing with the people of falsehood , and exacting revenge on the crusaders and apostates , until Allah's decree came and the muj āhidīn were granted authority in the land They implemented His Shar ī ' ah , established the prayer , commanded the good , and forbade the evil { [ And they are ] those who , if We give them authority in the land , establish prayer and give zak āh and enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong } [ Al-Hajj : 41 ] They continue upon this path today under the banner of the Khil āfah , even as the forces of kufr redouble their efforts to stop their advance across West Africa , for no sooner had they declared their bay'ah than they were faced with a combined and aggressive air and ground offensive launched by the murtadd forces of Chad and Niger This is in addition to the troops recently deployed from Cameroon , as well as mercenaries , and even the French crusaders based in Chad , all attempting to stop the muj āhidīn ' s liberation of West Africa We ask Allah to keep their feet firm against those seeking to uproot His Shar ī ' ah "
1,"This month , the soldiers of the Khil āfah sent a forceful message to the camp of kufr and riddah , striking and terrorizing them in multiple lands , and with no visas , borders , and passports to stand in the way Strikes were carried out in Yemen and Tunisia by men whose allegiance lies , not with a false citizenship , but with Allah , His Messenger , and the believers They readily sacrificed themselves for the cause of Allah in their own lands , bringing massacre to the disbelievers and murtadd īn , not differentiating between them on grounds of nationalism In the city of Tunis , two soldiers of the Islamic State carried out an assault on kāfir tourists in the Bardo National Museum The two muj āhidīn , Abū Zakariyy ā at-T ūnusī and Abū Anas at-T ūnusī , were sent on their mission after having trained with their brothers in Libya and having declared their bay'ah to the Khal īfah ( hafidhahull āh ) They returned to Tunisia , bravely advanced towards the security quarter in Tunis , entered the museum – located across from the Tunisian parliament – and poured terror on the kuff ār inside , killing more than 20 of them and injuring a dozen others They then faced off against the local murtadd security forces with their AK assault rifles , hand grenades , and explosive belts , and were killed fī sab īlillāh The operation succeeded in bringing anguish to a number of the nations involved in the crusader coalition ( Italy , France , Britain , Japan , Poland , Australia , Spain , and Belgium ) , after some of their own citizens became prey for the soldiers of the Islamic State Just two days later in Wil āyat Sanaa , four soldiers of the Islamic State carried out coordinated istishh ādī attacks against the Houthi murtadd īn in the city of Sanaa They infiltrated two temples where the Houthis had gathered and detonated their explosives , leading to a massacre that killed over a hundred , including the top Rāfidī cleric Murtad ā al-Mahatwar ī and a number of Houthi leaders , and also injured hundreds more At around the same time , a fifth muj āhid carried out an operation in Sa'dah , targeting a Houthi government building and detonating his explosives Only days after the operations , the Americans announced that they had pulled the last of their special forces out of Yemen These operations brought back memories of the blessed attacks ordered by Shaykh Abū Mus'ab az-Zarq āwī ( rahimahull āh ) , targeting the Iraqi Rāfidah and killing their cleric Muhammad Bāqir al-Hak īm On the heels of this blessed operation in Sanaa and Sa'dah , the Yemen ī branch of al-Q ā ' idah came out and exposed its two-faced nature by denouncing the attack and reaffirming their adherence to Dhaw āhiri ' s guidelines , as if to imply that the Islamic State's operation was carried out against Sunnis in a public place of gathering not specific to the Houthis , when in reality the opposite was true When one contrasts this blessed operation with al-Q ā ' idah's attack on a Houthi rally in Tahrir Square in Sanaa last fall , the blatant hypocrisy becomes evident : Is it permissible for Al-Qa'idah – according to Dhaw āhiri ' s feeble guidelines – to bomb a Houthi rally in a public square , but forbidden for the Islamic State to bomb a Houthi gathering in a Houthi temple Or is this distinction based on blind partisanship May Allah accept all those muj āhidīn who fight , massacre , and terrorize the kuff ār while not differentiating between them under the influence of irj ā ' or on the grounds of nationalism "
1,"This week , the Islamic State released a video depicting the execution of the Jordanian crusader pilot , Mu ' ādh Sāfī Yūsuf al-Kas āsibah As displayed in the video , the Islamic State had resolved to burn him alive as retribution for his crimes against Islam and the Muslims , including his active involvement in crusader airstrikes against Muslim lands When the news of the video broke out , the tāghūt of Jordan who at the time was in Washington to meet with his masters at the White House – as is the habit of the crusader puppets – cut short his trip , returned home early , and promptly ordered the execution of the muj āhidah , Sājidah ar-R īshāwī and the muj āhid , Ziy ād al-Karb ūlī , both of whom had been imprisoned for nearly a decade by the murtadd īn of Jordan The Islamic State had done everything it could to secure the release of both Sājidah and Ziy ād , but Allah decreed that they would return to Him as shuhad ā ' , an incomparable honor which they had both desired , eagerly pursued , and supplicated their Lord for We consider them so , and Allah is their judge In executing the muj āhidīn , Jordan is merely hastening the inevitable destruction of its tāghūt regime ""Allah's Messenger ( sallall āhu ' alayhi wa sallam ) said , "" Whoever harms an ally of Mine , then I have declared war against him "" [ Sah īh al-Bukh ārī ] While the execution of Sājidah and Ziy ād became the focus of international headlines , the focus for many ignorant hizbiyy īn became the manner in which the pilot was executed Amongst them was the Jordanian Abū Sayy āf Muhammad ash-Shalab ī , who stated , "" The manner in which he was executed and the subsequent production of a video displaying his execution is a matter that opposes the teachings of the pure religion Jih ād was legislated to make the people enter the religion , not to make them turn away from the religion or to distort its image . This type of rhetoric is typical of hizbiyy īn – even those masquerading as supporters of the muj āhidīn – who continue to live under the authority of the murtadd puppets , and of defeatist Muslims who reside in the lands of kufr under the authority of the crusaders themselves , with no intention of making hijrah to those lands in which the word of Allah is the highest Such people have had their religion diluted and , not surprisingly , are always amongst the first to speak out in any case where the muj āhidīn display their harshness towards the crusaders , attempting to disguise their criticism towards the muj āhidīn as concern for the image of Islam In burning the crusader pilot alive and burying him under a pile of debris , the Islamic State carried out a just form of retaliation for his involvement in the crusader bombing campaign which continues to result in the killing of countless Muslims who , as a result of these airstrikes , are burned alive and buried under mountains of debris This is not to even mention those Muslims – men , women , and children – who survive the airstrikes and are left injured and disabled , and in many cases suffering from severe burns that cause them pain and anguish every minute of every day This āyāh sufficiently demonstrates the shar ' ī validity of burning someone alive in a case of qis ās ( retribution ) The confusion perpetuated by the hizbiyy īn , the palace "" scholars , "" and the ignorant defeatists , is with regards to the authentic statement of Allah's Messenger ( sallall āhu ' alayhi wa sallam ) , "" None should punish with fire except Allah "" [ Sah īh al-Bukh ārī ] As a result of their dishonesty in conveying the truth , the deviants concealed the fact that there is a famous exception to this ruling made in the case of qis ās and maslahah ( overwhelming benefit ) , and that in addition to the aforementioned āyah from Sūrat An-Nahl , the fuqah ā ' used as evidence for these exceptions the following āyah from Sūrat Al-Baqarah { So whoever has assaulted you , then assault him in the same way that he has assaulted you } [ Al-Baqarah : 194 ] They further used as evidence the had īth of the ' Uran ī men whose eyes were gouged out by the Prophet ( sallall āhu ' alayhi wa sallam ) with heated iron [ Al-Bukh ārī and Muslim ] Furthermore , the scholars highlighted the fact that the Sah ābah ( radiyall āhu ' anhum ) punished people with fire in a number of incidents that took place throughout the course of the history of the rightly-guided Khulaf ā ' Here we will mention some of these incidents The first example : In his letter to the murtadd īn of the Arabian Peninsula during the riddah wars , Abū Bakr as-Sidd īq ( radiyall āhu ' anh ) threatened to burn them alive if they did not repent from their riddah In it he states , "" I have sent to you so and so [ Khālid Ibn al-Wal īd ] with an army of the Muh ājirīn , the Ans ār , and their good followers , and I've ordered him to not fight anyone or kill anyone until he calls him to the call of Allah Whoever answers him , accepts the truth , halts his evil , and does good , my envoy will accept this from him and will aid him in it If he refuses , I've ordered him to wage war against them over such , to not spare anyone he is able to kill , to burn them alive with fire , to kill them in a severe manner using all means , to enslave their women and children , and to not accept from any one of them anything but Islam "" [ Tārīkh at-Tabar ī ; Al-Bid āyah wan-Nih āyah ] The second example : Likewise during his khil āfah , Abū Bakr ( radiyall āhu ' anh ) gathered a number of his advisors from amongst the Sah ābah and consulted them about the case of a man found guilty of committing sodomy The one who had the most severe position was ' Alī ( radiyall āhu ' anh ) who said , "" This is a sin that no nation had committed before except for one nation , and you know how Allah dealt with them I view that we should burn him alive . So the Sah ābah agreed with his position , and Abū Bakr wrote to Khālid ordering him to burn the man alive [ Al-Bayhaq ī ] The third example : In another incident that occurred during the riddah wars , a man named al-Fuj ā ' ah came to Abū Bakr as-Sidd īq ( radiyall āhu ' anh ) claiming to be Muslim , and asked Abū Bakr to prepare an army for him to lead in fighting the murtadd īn Abū Bakr did so , and the man wound up killing and robbing anyone he came across , including Muslims When this reached Abū Bakr , he sent an army to detain him He was detained and brought back , and Abū Bakr ordered that he be taken to the area of al-Baq ī ' and burned alive [ Al-Bid āyah wan-Nih āyah ] The fourth example : During the riddah wars , when Khālid Ibn al-Wal īd defeated Tulayhah al-Asad ī in the battle of Buz ākhah , Abū Bakr wrote to him ordering him to not be lenient and to make an example out of anyone he captured from amongst the kuff ār who had killed Muslims So Khālid remained in Buz ākhah for a month hunting down the murtadd īn and taking revenge for the Muslims who had been killed Some of the murtadd īn he would burn alive , others he would stone to death , and others he would throw off the tops of mountains [ Al-Bid āyah wan-Nih āyah ] The fifth example : Abū Mūsā al-Ash'ar ī reported that the Prophet ( sallall āhu ' alayhi wa sallam ) sent both him and Mu ' ādh Ibn Jabal ( radiyall āhu ' anhum ā ) to Yemen , and instructed them to teach the people the Qur ' ān Mu ' ādh came one day to visit Abū Mūsā and found with him a man who was chained up , so he said , "" O my brother , were we sent to punish the people or were we sent to teach them and order them with what would benefit them ? So Abū Mūsā said , "" He embraced Islam and then disbelieved . So Mu ' ādh said , "" By He who sent Muhammad with the truth , I will not leave until I burn him with fire . So Abū Mūsā said , "" We still have some unfinished business with him . So Mu ' ādh said , "" By Allah , I will never leave ! So some firewood was brought and a fire was lit , and he threw him in [ Al-Mu'jam al-Kab īr – at-Tabar ānī ] Thus , the Islamic State not only followed the footsteps of Allah's Messenger ( sallall āhu ' alayhi wa sallam ) in his harshness towards the disbelievers , but also emulated the example of his righteous Sah ābah ( radiyall āhu ' anhum ) by punishing with fire in retaliation , and for the purpose of terrorizing the murtadd īn and making examples out of them We ask Allah to take revenge for the Muslims and the muj āhidīn , and rain fire and destruction upon the kuff ār and murtadd īn wherever they are "
1,"A short time before the formal expansion of the American crusade into Shām , the official spokesman of the Islamic State – Shaykh Abū Muhammad al-'Adn ānī ash-Sh āmī ( hafidhahull āh ) – gave a momentous speech inspiring the Muslims , terrifying the crusaders , and reminding all with Allah's promise Alhamdulill āh , a number of matters unfolded almost immediately after the speech in obedience to the leaders of the Islam - ic State , including the capture of crusaders in Muslim lands and their subsequent execution , the killing of crusaders in their homelands , and the conquering of new areas in Iraq and Shām despite the crusader airstrikes At the same time , the Arab taw āghīt , the sahw āt , the quasi-jihadists , and mock muj āhidīn exposed their duplicity and hypocrisy once again for no sincere Muslim to be left in the dark with doubt And all praise is due to Allah the Lord of the worlds What follows are some of the most important excerpts from his speech "" O soldiers of the Islamic State , what a great thing you have achieved by Allah Your reward is upon Him By Allah , He has healed the chests of the believers through the killing of the nusayriyyah and rāfidah at your hands He has filled the hearts of the disbelievers and hypocrites with rage through you What a great thing you have achieved by Allah Who are you Who are you O soldiers of the Islamic State From where have you come What is your secret Why is it that the hearts of the East and West are dislocat ed by their fear of you Why is it that the chest muscles of America and its allies shiver out of fear of you Where are your warplanes Where are your battleships Where are your missiles Where are your weapons of mass destruction Why is it that the world has united against you Why have the nations of disbelief entrenched together against you ? "" So know that – by Allah – we fear not the swarms of planes , nor ballistic missiles , nor drones , nor satellites , nor battleships , nor weapons of mass destruction How could we fear them , while Allah the Exalted has said , { If Allah should aid you , no one can overcome you ; but if He should forsake you , who is there that can aid you after Him And upon Allah let the believers rely } [ Āli ' Imr ān : 160 ] How could we fear them , while Allah the Exalted has said , { So do not weaken and do not grieve , and you will be superior if you are [ true ] believers } [ Āli ' Imr ān : 139 ] . "" Therefore Allah will give you victory Indeed , Allah will give you victory By Allah , Allah will give you victory So guarantee for us two matters , and we will guarantee you – by Allah's permission – constant victory and consolidation First , do not oppress anyone nor be content with oppression by being silent about it and not raising the matter to those in authority Second , do not become conceited or arrogant This is what we fear from you and fear for you . "" Thereafter know that a trial , sifting , and selection , are necessary between one period and another , for some people have entered your ranks who are not of you and are only claimants And thus some disorder has occurred So it has be - come necessary for a trial to come , expel the filth , and purify the ranks We ask Allah for forgiveness and wellness Also , pride and conceit has entered some of our souls , and thus some of us transgressed and oppressed others So it is necessary for the sins to be expelled , so that you may return to your Lord Allah has loved the muj āhidīn , and so there is no choice but for Him to take some martyrs We ask Allah to make us of them , not from the disgraced nor those afflicted [ in their religion ] . "" O America , O allies of America , and O crusaders , know that the matter is more dangerous than you have imagined and greater than you have envisioned We have warned you that to - day we are in a new era , an era where the State , its soldiers , and its sons are leaders not slaves They are a people who through the ages have not known defeat The outcome of their battles is concluded before they begin They have not prepared for a battle since the time of Noah except with absolute conviction of victory Being killed – according to their account – is a victory This is where the secret lies You fight a people who can never be defeated . "" And so we promise you by Allah's permission that this campaign will be your final campaign It will be broken and defeated , just as all your previous campaigns were broken and defeated , except that this time we will raid you thereafter , and you will never raid us We will conquer your Rome , break your crosses , and enslave your women , by the permission of Allah , the Exalted This is His promise to us ; He is glorified and He does not fail in His promise If we do not reach that time , then our children and grandchildren will reach it , and they will sell your sons as slaves at the slave market . "" So mobilize your forces , O crusaders Mobilize your forces , roar with thunder , threaten whom you want , plot , arm your troops , prepare yourselves , strike , kill , and destroy us This will not avail you You will be defeated This will not avail you , for our Lord , the Mighty , the Prevailing , has promised us with our victory and your defeat Send arms and equipment to your agents and dogs Prepare them with the most modern equipment Send them very much , for it will end up as war booty in our hands by Allah's permission You will spend it , then it will be a source of regret for you , then you will be defeated Look at your armored vehicles , machinery , weaponry , and equipment It is in our hands Allah granted it to us We fight you with it So die in your rage { Indeed , those who disbelieve spend their wealth to avert [ people ] from the way of Allah So they will spend it ; then it will be for them a [ source of ] regret ; then they will be overcome And those who have disbelieved – unto Hell they will be gathered } [ Al-Anf āl : 36 ] .

You will pay the price as you are afraid of travelling to any land Rather you will pay the price as you walk on your streets , turning right and left , fearing the Muslims You will not feel secure even in your bedrooms You will pay the price when this crusade of yours collapses , and thereafter we will strike you in your homeland , and you will never be able to harm anyone afterwards You will pay the price , and we have prepared for you what will pain you . "" Dear Muslims , America hasn't come with its crusade in order to save the Muslims , nor does it spend its wealth in spite of the collapse of its economy and burden itself in order to arm and train the sahwah councils in Shām and Iraq out of compassion and fear for the mujahidin from the "" cruelty of the khaw ārij , "" and out of support for them as they allege { I wish my people could know !

Woe to my people When will they remember ? "" So O muwahhid , do not let this battle pass you by wherever you may be You must strike the soldiers , patrons , and troops of the taw āghīt Strike their police , security , and intelligence members , as well as their treacherous agents Destroy their beds Embitter their lives for them and busy them with themselves If you can kill a disbelieving American or European – especially the spiteful and filthy French – or an Australian , or a Canadian , or any other disbeliever from the disbelievers waging war , including the citizens of the countries that entered into a coalition against the Islamic State , then rely upon Allah , and kill him in any manner or way however it may be Do not ask for anyone's advice and do not seek anyone's verdict Kill the disbeliever whether he is civilian or military , for they have the same ruling .

1,"Praise be to Allah , and peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah , and upon his family , and his companions and allies As for what follows ..The Muslims have continuously received one piece of good news after another since the announcement of the re-establishment of the blessed Islamic Khil āfah One of the most recent pieces of good news was that the group "" Ans ār al-Islam in Iraq "" , including both its leaders and its soldiers , has pledged allegiance to the Islamic State The bay'ah took place on the 29th of Shaww āl , and was accompanied by the announcement that their banner would be dissolved , and that all their troops , weapons , and capabilities would be placed at the disposal of the Islamic State This bay'ah comes at a time when the Islamic State is facing a growing list of enemies , and it further underscores the fact that the lines are being drawn and the camps of īmān and kufr are both being cleansed This will eventually lead to a camp of kufr with no trace of īmān , and a camp of īmān with no trace of hypocrisy , as per the statement of the Prophet ( sallall āhu ' alayhi wa sallam ) There will be no room to sit on the fence , and all parties will soon be forced to make a choice between the two The soldiers of Ans ār al-Islam have made their choice , and in doing so have exposed themselves to the enmity and hatred of the entire world for the sake of unifying the ranks of the muj āhidīn We consider this a sign of their sincerity , and Allah is their judge We ask Allah to keep them firm upon the truth The following is an excerpt from Ans ār al-Islam's last official announcement : This bay'ah came after a number of gatherings and meetings held with the mash āyikh of the Islamic State who clarified for us the legality of the Islamic State's mission with clear shar ' ī and intellectual arguments The last of these meetings was on the 29th of Shaww āl , in which we pledged our allegiance both individually and in groups Prior to this , it became clear to us that the Islamic State had a presence on the ground as a state with numerous institutions that could hold its weight in the region This is the state that defeated the crusaders , broke the strength of the safaw īs , wiped out the apostate sahw āt , and rubbed the faces of the secularist Kurds in the dirt This is the state that opened the lands of Islam , brought an end to the artificial borders between the lands of the Muslims , broke the shackles of the prisoners , and freed the lions This is the state that established the laws of Allah , carried out the hud ūd , set up the various administrative offices , and brought justice to the oppressed This is the state that spread safety and security , and took up the responsibility of caring for the orphans and the needy And we witnessed all this and more with our own eyes , and felt it with our own hands , so may Allah grant them the best of rewards on behalf of the Muslims "
1,"All praise is due to Allah , the Lord of the worlds May blessings and peace be upon His messenger , Muhammad , and upon his family and companions As to what follows : History repeats itself by Allah's divine decree This is the sunnah ( established way ) of Allah in His creation { This is the sunnah of Allah with those who passed on before ; and you will not find in the way of Allah any change } [ Al-Ahz āb : 62 ] { This is the sunnah of Allah which has occurred before And never will you find in the way of Allah any change . [ Al-Fath : 23 ] There is no escape from this divine decree It must happen and it certainly will Since the collapse of the mushrik īn in Arabia , Persia , and India at the hands of the Sah ābah and the Tābi ' īn , the bulk of all jih ād was against the cross-worshipping Romans with Shām playing an important role in all the wars between the Muslims and crusaders And this will be the case until their tāghūt cross is broken by the Mas īh ' Īsa ( ' alayhis-sal ām ) As this final crusade carries on and prior to its short pause followed by crusader treachery ( whenever that occurs ) , it is important to reflect over a number of matters We ask Allah to make us from the people of vision , not from a deaf , dumb , and blind people who do not understand Abū Hurayrah reported that Allah's Messenger ( sallall āhu ' alayhi wa sallam ) said , "" The Hour will not be established until the Romans land at al-A'm āq or Dābiq ( two places near each other in the northern countryside of Halab ) Then an army from Mad īnah of the best people on the earth at that time will leave for them When they line up in ranks the Romans will say , ' Leave us and those who were enslaved from amongst us so we can fight them . ' The Muslims will say , ' Nay , by Allah , we will not abandon our brothers to you . ' So they will fight them Then one third of them will flee ; Allah will never forgive them One third of them will be killed ; they will be the best martyrs with Allah And one third will conquer them ; they will never be afflicted with fitnah Then they will conquer Constantinople While they are dividing the war booty , having hung their swords on olive trees , Shayt ān will shout , ' The [ false ] Messiah has followed after your families [ who were left behind . ] ' So they will leave [ for their families ] , but Shayt ān ' s claim is false When they arrive to Shām he comes out Then when they are preparing for battle and filing their ranks , the prayer is called So ' Īsā Ibn Maryam ( sallall āhu ' alayhi wa sallam ) will descend and lead them When the enemy of Allah sees him , he will melt as salt melts in water If he were to leave him he would melt until he perished , but he kills him with his own hand , and then shows them his blood upon his spear "" [ Sah īh Muslim ] ""Allah's Messenger ( sallall āhu ' alayhi wa sallam ) said , "" You will have a treaty of security with the Romans until you both fight an enemy beyond them And you will be victorious , you will gain war booty , and you will achieve such without losses Thereafter you will return until you lodge at a pastureland full of rocky mounds A man from the Roman Christians will then raise the cross He will say , ' The cross has prevailed ! ' A man from the Muslims will then say , ' Rather Allah has prevailed , ' and then he will angrily rise and crush the cross , which is not at a distance from him Then the Romans will betray the treaty by rising against the breaker of the cross and striking his neck The Muslims will then rise and rush to their arms They will then battle Allah will bless this party of Muslims with shah ādah The Romans will say to the Roman leader , ' We are sufficient for you against the Arabs . ' They will then gather for the Malhamah ( the grand battle before the Hour ) They will come for you under eighty banners , with each banner there will be twelve thousand people "" [ Sah īh – reported by Imām Ahmad , Abū Dāwūd , Ibn Mājah , Ibn Hibb ān , and al-H ākim on the authority of Dhī Mikhmar ] ""' Abdull āh Ibn Mas ' ūd ( radiyall āhu ' anh ) said , "" The Last Hour will not come until the people stop dividing inheritance and rejoicing over booty . Then he said , while pointing towards Shām , "" An enemy shall muster strength against the Muslims and the Muslims will muster strength against them . Yusayr Ibn Jābir asked him , "" You mean the Romans ? He said , "" Yes , and there will be a great raddah ( fleeing ) and the Muslims will prepare a detachment for fighting unto death so that they may not return but victorious They will fight until night will intervene between them ; both sides will return without being victorious and the detachment will be wiped out The Muslims will again prepare a detachment for fighting unto death so that they may not return but victorious They will fight until night comes upon them ; both sides will return without being victorious and the detachment will be wiped out When it is the fourth day , a new detachment from the remnant of the Muslims will be prepared and Allah will decree that the enemy would be routed And they will fight such a fight the like of which will not be seen ( or which has not been seen ) , so much so that even if a bird were to pass their flanks , it would fall down dead before reaching the end of them ( After the battle ) , when relatives count each other , they will find that after being one hundred , only one man is left from them So what can be the joy at the spoils of such war and what inheritance can be divided While they are in this very state , they will hear of a calamity more horrible than this And a cry will reach them , ' The Dajj āl has taken your place among your families . ' They will , therefore , throw away what is in their hands and go forward sending ten horsemen as a scouting party ""Allah's Messenger ( sallall āhu ' alayhi wa sallam ) said , ' I know their names and the names of their fathers and the color of their horses They will be the best horsemen on the surface of the earth on that day or amongst the best horsemen on the surface of the earth on that day ' "" [ Sah īh Muslim ] These ahādīth indicate that the Muslims will be at war with the Roman Christians Rome in the Arabic tongue of the Prophet ( sallall āhu ' alayhi wa sallam ) refers to the Christians of Europe and their colonies in Shām prior to the conquering of Shām at the hands of the Sah ābah There will be a pause in this war due to a truce or treaty During this time , the Muslims and Romans will fight a common enemy The fact that they fight a common enemy does not necessitate there is any form of military cooperation between them , as some of the had īth commentators have said , "" Or [ it means ] you fight your enemy on your own while they fight their [ same ] enemy on their own "" [ Hāshiyat as-Sind ī ' Alā Sunan Ibn Mājah ] This is closer to the teachings of the Prophet ( sallall āhu ' alayhi wa sallam ) , who said , "" I will not seek the aid of a mushrik "" [ Sah īh Muslim ] In another wording , he ( sallall āhu ' alayhi wa sallam ) said , "" We do not seek the aid of a mushrik "" [ Imām Ahmad and Ibn Hibb ān ] He ( sallall āhu ' alayhi wa sallam ) also said , "" We do not seek the aid of the mushrik īn against the mushrik īn "" [ Hasan : reported by Imām Ahmad , al-H ākim , and others ] Then the Romans will commit treachery by raising the cross and killing a Muslim This will lead to the continuation of the war between the Muslims and the Romans They will demand access to those who enslaved some of them or the former captives themselves who accepted Islam so as to fight them This enslavement will have taken place either before the signing of the truce or after the treachery , and Allah knows best These events all lead up to the final , greatest , and bloodiest battle – al-Malhamah al - Kubr ā – between the Muslims and the Romans prior to the appearance of the Dajj āl and the descent of al-Mas īh This battle ends the era of the Roman Christians , as the Muslims will then advance upon Constantinople and thereafter Rome , to conquer the two cities and raise the flag of the Khil āfah over them "
1,"Forgive me in advance , but there are many references to myself in the following article I dislike talking about myself , it appears arrogant , but it's my voice and words being analyzed by journalists following the release of videos shot by the Islamic State And to put things into perspective , I have to tell parts of my story One observation is that the videos are scripted , and that perhaps I have no choice in the content This is not true The mujahidin suggest initial titles , I write the scripts , hand them over for any copy changes that need to be made and the videos are shot ""It's all very fast – the first eight videos were written , approved and filmed in just 12 days – but the mujahidin are like that In quick , get the job done , move on to the next task When your brain has had nothing to work on for two years except basic survival , and is suddenly put onto centre stage in front of the world's media , it's a shock to the system Nothing , nothing , kablam ""You're on I was used to working for the news before , not being the news , and it's very different Every word you say is examined , especially if you're in my situation So to really understand the content of the films , and why I say what I sometimes say , you need to appreciate the story behind the scenes As a friend , once said to me , I am nobody going nowhere I am just a man in a dark room with a mattress on the floor It is clean and comfortable ; for a man in my position , it is enough Four of my cellmates have already been executed by the Islamic State in the most visceral way possible after the British and American governments apparently made a joint decision not to discuss terms for our release with our captors And now , unless something changes very quickly and very radically , I await my turn Such an environment forces the mind to change ""I've had to become pretty tough inside , sometimes just to get through each day The Sheikh who originally captured James Foley and me back in November 2012 said , "" to go through this you will need a heart of stone . And he was right I try to stay very calm , tolerant and accepting of my situation Muslims call it ' Qadr Allah , ' the will of God , who determines everything in advance I am thankful for any comfort I receive and for every plate of food I get It hasn't been an easy road , and some of us had a bumpy ride Once we were finally put into general population with dozens of European prisoners , we had to watch them all go home to their loved ones while we , the British and Americans , were left behind That was a bitter pill to swallow , but nothing compared to what came next Now I've had to watch as James , Steven Sotloff , David Haines and Alan Henning walked out of the door , one every two weeks since August 18th , never to return , knowing they were going to be killed and going to their deaths And now they're gone , their faces and deaths plastered all over the world's headlines , four foolish policy victims What does that do to a man After enduring years of pain , darkness and regret , to see it all end in such a ghastly way when everyone else went home , to see ordinary guys , family men , loving fathers killed because their governments wouldn't negotiate because of ' policy , ' wouldn't even discuss options for saving them with their families – can you begin to imagine how that feels This wasn't a fateful soul taken at random , it was individuals missing for years in one of the most high-profile hostage crisis seen in modern history , with dozens of witnesses who had gone home testifying they were alive and could be helped I believe even the mujahidin were genuinely surprised at how easily our countries left us for dead ""We'd come all this way , putting one foot in front of the other , supporting one another when it got tough , praying together every day We used to call it the Dead Zone when things got bad , after the area Everest climbers face above 26,000 feet as they approach the summit , when every step is agony , when they hardly have enough strength to carry on We never gave up hope that our nations would negotiate for our release But all that time , we never knew that the decision regarding our fate had been made months beforehand in Washington and Whitehall We never knew that our families , for whom it was like being locked up in prison with us , were being blanked by the governments or being told there was nothing they could do We never knew that the families were left to themselves to try anything and everything , while the men in charge folded their arms and offered their sympathies What does that do to a man It makes you deeply upset at such gross injustice ""That's for sure I am not in possession of all the facts , and of course , I am biased But how the head of state of any country could sit and watch us die here like this , then criticize their NATO partners for getting their people home seems utterly ruthless Since when has not wanting to see your citizens executed in front of the world's media been an act of weakness America has paid ransoms and exchanged prisoners for hostages held by terrorist groups be - fore Just this year there was the release of Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl in Afghanistan , who was exchanged for no less than five high-level prisoners out of Guantanamo Britain has also paid ransoms and exchanged prisoners for hostages with known terror groups In 1991 Terry Waite finally came home for a ransom of around $ 5 million , while a clandestine prisoner exchange took place with the Kosovo Liberation Army That was in 1994 , I believe But not us Somehow we slipped through every safety net , every policy change , and ended up on the floor of what will surely go down as one of the worst hostage disasters of recent times Yes , America tried to ' rescue ' us , but instead of spending all those millions of dollars sending ninja comman - dos in stealth helicopters and risking countless more lives like it was some Hollywood action movie , wouldn't it have been safer and wiser to have just discussed options for prisoner exchange in the first place Even if nothing could have been agreed , surely it was worth discussing with the Islamic State What possible harm could come from negotiations I will never understand why we were deemed so expendable , but that doesn't really matter now To watch your friends die the way they did when there seemed so much that could have been done to prevent it at a political level has been extremely difficult I expected the hardest knocks to come from inside these prison walls , not outside , and it's almost torn me in two Britain is a small country , an island nation with old traditions that used to mean something Now I don't know ""It's not until you get into a situation as extreme as this that you start to doubt everything you thought you ever knew Here in prison , we'd lived inside an absolute vacuum for two years Of the outside world , I knew nothing The most complicated piece of apparatus I'd handled was occasionally opening a can of processed meat ; now there's something called an iWatch Then we started work on these videos and as part of the research process , I was allowed to read news downloads on the impending war in Iraq and Syria , and on our particular situation And the more I read , the deeper it cut I was so devastated to read about the lack of support for the families involved in our case that I wanted to make my voice heard on the matter "" We had to find a way through this on our own , "" Diane Foley told reporters Having watched Obama's address to the nation on September 10th , I was appalled at the way the names of my dead friends were used to beat the drums of war , like they were being used to incite the public into supporting military action I watched Steven's mother making a televised plea to the Islamic State to spare her son after her government declined to discuss anything with her , and read how Diane Foley was threatened with ' funding terrorism ' charges as she tried to raise a ransom I read emails from the mothers who'd sent letters to the President begging for help , and another where they'd directly contacted the family of one of the Muslim prisoners wanted in exchange for us to see if there was anything , anything they could do I learned about the failed rescue attempt , how our chances of survival were rated as so low that it was considered the best option "" The intelligence was a bit stale , but you couldn't not give it a swing , "" said a spokesman It was as if our lives and the lives of our families were just a game of baseball And here's the thing : if our countries had just talked to the mujahidin , our chances of survival wouldn't have been low at all The pain and indignation of learning all of this was indescribable Everything we'd based our belief on had been an illusion It was within this context that the videos were filmed , and I used my voice to speak out against what I had seen I was startled at what I'd learned , deeply hurt and realized I was desperately naïve That we'd all been I knew we were not important people , not special in any way ""We'd found ourselves into a real bad spot and desperately needed help but I couldn't grasp how we were just considered an irritant to two of the most influential countries in the world , when all the European leaders engaged in discussions that ensured the safe return home of their people Having chosen not to negotiate , our politicians must have known we'd be executed , yet it was decided that if the rescue didn't work ( and they're always a last-gasp option ) then that was okay Better we were beheaded one by one than talk to our captors If that is policy , it's insanity I never told the others what I'd learned while they were still alive ""I'd been moved to my small cell and had chosen to stay , so couldn't talk to them anyway I find the close confines of the walls stop my mind wandering too far and I can focus more , keep myself in check in my solitude It was probably better the others didn't know Such a litany of anguish would only have filled them with fear and anger The mujahidin have kindly given me a voice the others never had I don't know why I deserved such a privilege , but I'd use that voice to say this : Please don't allow these deaths to fade quietly into the night – there is more to this than meets the eye The public have no appetite for consecutive beheadings of their countrymen in 2014 , so why was this allowed to happen The Islamic State is not some bunch of guerillas or gangsters They have 32,000 fighters , tanks , missile system , law courts , a police force and they control the second largest city in Iraq Surely they must be considered large enough and serious enough for any politician to deal with To my darling wife , my friends in the media and my family : let our political leaders know it doesn't have to be this way Our political leaders have the power , if they choose to change things For now , I am still alive , but at some point in the near future , the mujahidin will surely run out of patience Just ask our government to talk ""That's all Open a channel and negotiate with the Islamic State like the others did If nothing is possible to agree on , then fine , but it cannot compromise policy to open a dialogue Death holds no fear over me ; I have lived beneath its wings for a long time But if that is to be my final destination , I would rather look it in the face knowing this was a fair fight and not a hollow capitulation "
1,"On Friday 2 Rab ī ' al-Awwal 1435AH ( 3 January 2014 ) , the Syrian Sahwah was launched against the Islamic State after the leadership of the factions gathered to plot their conspiracy "" Jaysh al-Muj āhidīn "" and "" Jabhat Thuww ār Sūriyā "" ( of Jam āl Ma'r ūf ) made the first move and were followed systematically by the "" Islamic Front "" and the Jawl ānī front One of the biggest allies of the Jawl ānī front since the beginning of the Sahwah has been the "" Islamic Front "" with Zahran Alloush as its top military commander In Sha'b ān , the crusaders of "" McClatchy "" interviewed Zahran Alloush in Turkey , the favored base of the Sahwah leadership The following are excerpts from an article the interviewers wrote summarizing the interview : "" Islamist rebel leader walks back rhetoric in first interview with U . S media . "" [ I ] n his first interview with U . S . news media , Alloush was the model of pragmatism . "" Gone were his previous calls to expel members of the ruling Alawite sect from Damascus In the interview he called them ' part of the Syrian people ' and said that only those with blood on their hands should be held accountable . "" Abandoned , too , was the talk of an Islamic state Now he said he favored allowing Syrians to decide what sort of state they wanted . "" ' We want to establish a state in which our rights are fulfilled , ' he said , denouncing what he called the ' sectarian discrimination ' against the Sunni Muslim majority ""' After that , the people should choose the sort of state they want . ' He said he would favor a ' technocratic , professional government . ' "" Asked by McClatchy to explain his change in stance , Alloush said his original statements were due to the pressure he lived under in Ghouta , the scene of a poison gas attack two years ago that killed hundreds . "" ' We are under siege We all suffer psychological stress When I was in prison and the jailer would come and torture prisoners , after he would leave , prisoners would quarrel and beat each other , ' he said . "" His spokesman , Islam Alloush , said the speeches Zahran Alloush had made in Ghouta were for internal consumption , to rally fighters in the face of other , far more radical Islamist forces , such as the Islamic State ""' There's speech for the internal audience and for the external audience , ' he said ""' The internal speech is devoted to saving our sons from joining the Islamic State . ' "" Has [ Zahran ] changed his views ""' That is a very good question , ' said Joshua Landis , a Syria expert at the University of Oklahoma who's written about Alloush Alloush and his staff ' are getting much more savvy , ' he said , based on Twitter conversations he's had with the commander's spokesman . "" ' Everybody is aware now that the regime is very weak and on the way to collapse , ' said Bassam Barabandi , a former Syrian diplomat who lives in Washington ""' And every major player wants to be acceptable to the West and to the international community . ' "" ' Zahran wants to be on the winning side , ' he said . "" Landis said Alloush would be there ""' He's going to be a winner , ' he said ""Alloush's Army of Islam and other Islamist groups , the ' hard-bitten patriotic types … will win in the end , ' he said . "" Presenting a new face may be one reason Alloush traveled to Istanbul , where he was interviewed , and was heading next to Jordan to confer with rebel commanders who operate in southern Syria , as well as their international backers His fighters need weapons . "" In his interview with McClatchy , he adhered to the moderate line : ' If we succeed in toppling the regime , we will leave it to the Syrian people to choose the form of state they want , ' he said ""' As for coexistence with minorities , this has been the situation in Syria for hundreds of years We are not seeking to impose our power on minorities or to practice oppression against them On the contrary , we have criticized the regime and fought it because it was practicing sectarian discrimination against the majority during the eras it ruled Syria . ' "" Another aide said that Alloush , to improve his image , was ready to dispense with the black and white Islamic flag and adopt the Syrian flag used by other rebel forces . "" [ Zahran ] said the Army of Islam had been in direct touch with Daniel Rubinstein , the Obama administration's special envoy for Syria , an assertion the State Department confirmed . That ends the words of Alloush's allies To summarize : He believes in self-determination , a cornerstone of democracy He believes in freedom of religion and religious coexistence , a cornerstone of secularist nationalism And he compromises religious fundamentals , meets with Jewish leaders part of the crusade against Islam , and raises banners of secularist jāhiliyyah for the sake of obtaining aid And yet , Alloush has been one of the top allies of "" al-Q ā ' idah "" in Syria ( the Jawl ānī front ) – openly having praised both Jawl ānī and al-Har ārī ( a major leader of the Jawl ānī front ) in interviews released officially by his "" Army of Islam . He himself has been praised by al-Har ārī via internet tweets Again , the deviance of Alloush has been something known to these jih ād claimants long before this recent interview and even before the official expansion of the Islamic State to Shām , and yet the Jawl ānī front supported the "" Islamic Front "" that Alloush led in the war against the Islamic State This interview was followed by a declaration by the allies of the Jawl ānī front condemning the Jawl ānī front's killing of more than twenty apostate Druze in the month of Sha'b ān in the village of Qalb Lawzah This was shortly after Jawl ānī ' s promise to not harm them during his interview with the Qatari tāghūt ' s channel , "" AlJazeera , "" and this policy is in accordance with Dhaw āhirī ' s "" General Guidelines for Jih ādī Action . Dhaw āhirī said under the section titled "" Necessary Guidelines , "" "" Fourthly : The deviant sects like the Rāfidah , Ism ā ' īliyyah , Qādiyāniyyah , and deviant Sūfiyyah , should not be fought , as long as they do not fight Ahlus-Sunnah And if they fight Ahlus-Sunnah , then the response should be limited to those combatant parties from amongst them while explaining that we only defend ourselves These sects ' non-combatants , the families of these sects at home , and their places of worship , celebration , and religious gatherings should not be targeted The exposing of their falsehood and deviant creed and conduct should carry on As for the places that fall under the control and authority of the muj āhidīn , then these sects should be treated with wisdom after da'wah , promoting awareness , exposing their doubts , enjoining good and forbidding evil in a manner that does not create a greater harm such as the expulsion of the muj āhidīn from those areas , or the revolting of the masses against them , or inciting a fitnah that the enemies exploit to occupy the region . This ends Dhaw āhirī ' s words Jawl ānī said in his interview , "" At this time , we do not fight those who do not fight us Here there are Druze villages that did not support Bashar al-Asad and did not fight They are present in the liberated areas and were not exposed to harm . And when he was asked by the interviewer , "" But you did not raid their villages , you did not destroy their homes , you did not seize their property , you did not destroy their temples , you did not do anything at all against them up until now ? He answered , "" No , not at all Not at all ... As for transgressing against them , then this has never occurred . Both of them called to the abandonment of jih ād against the Druze apostates Shaykhul-Isl ām Ibn Taymiyyah was asked about the ruling upon the Nusayriyyah and the Druze and answered , "" The Druze and the Nusayriyyah are kuff ār according to the agreement of the Muslims It is not permissible to eat what they slaughter nor marry their women Rather , they cannot be acknowledged with jizyah , for they are apostates from the religion of Islam , not Muslims , nor Jews , nor Christians They do not recognize the obligation of the five daily prayers , nor the obligation of the Ramad ān fast , nor the obligation of hajj , nor the prohibition of what Allah and His Messenger have prohibited of dead animals , alcohol , and so on And if they manifest the two testimonies of faith [ there is no god but Allah and Muhammad is His messenger ] alongside these tenets of creed , then they are kuff ār according to the agreement of the Muslims … As for the Druze , then they are the followers of Hashtak īn ad-Darz ī who was one of the followers of al-H ākim [ the apostate ' Ubayd ī ruler ] Al-H ākim sent him to the people of the valley of Taymull āh Ibn Tha'labah and called them to believe in the godhood of al-H ākim They call him ' al-B ārī al-'All ām ' [ The Creator , the All-Knowing ] and swear by him They are from the Ism ā ' īliyyah who claim that Muhammad Ibn Ism ā ' īl abrogated the Shar ī ' ah of Muhammad Ibn ' Abdill āh They are worse in kufr than the extreme Shī ' ah They claim that the world existed eternally and deny the obligations and prohibitions of Islam They are from the Bātinī Qar āmitah [ those who claim the religion has secret meanings contradicting its apparent meanings ] who are worse in kufr than the Jews , the Christians , and the pagan Arabs They ultimately strive to be philosophers upon the doctrine of Aristotle and his likes or the Maj ūs Their doctrine is a combination of the doctrines of the philosophers and the Maj ūs They hypocritically manifest Shiism "" [ Majm ū ' al-Fat āwā ] He also said describing the Druze , "" The kufr of these people is a matter over which the Muslims do not differ Rather whoever doubts their kufr is a kāfir like them They are not at the level of Ahlul-Kit āb nor the mushrik īn Rather , they are from the most deviant kuff ār , and so the meat they slaughter is not hal āl Their women can be taken as slaves and their property can be seized They are apostate heretics whose repentance cannot be accepted Rather they are to be killed wherever they are found and cursed as they were described It is not permissible to use them as guards , gatekeepers , or custodians It is obligatory to kill their scholars and religious figures so that they do not misguide others It is prohibited to sleep at their homes , accompany them , walk with them , or follow their funeral processions if their deaths are known It is prohibited for the Muslims ' authorities to abandon the order of Allah by not executing the hud ūd upon them "" [ Majm ū ' al-Fat āwā ] He also said describing the Bātiniyyah ( which include the Druze ) , "" If these people are overcome , they manifest repentance because the basis of their doctrine is taqiyyah and concealment of their condition Amongst them are those who will be known and amongst them are those who might not become known So the best way to deal with them is to be cautious concerning their matter They should not be allowed to remain together , nor should they be allowed to carry arms , nor should they be allowed to become from the soldiers They should be forced to abide by the laws of Islam , including the five daily prayers and recitation of the Qur ' ān There should remain amongst them those who will teach them the religion of Islam and they should be left with these teachers … And whoever is from the leaders of their deviance and manifests repentance should be expelled from their places and taken to the main lands of the Muslims where these sects have no manifest presence so that either Allah guides him or he dies upon his hypocrisy without harming the Muslims "" [ Majm ū ' al-Fat āwā ] These are the fat āwā of Shaykhul-Isl ām explaining that the Druze cannot be considered ahl dhimmah , that they are worse than the Jews and Christians , and that if they repent and accept Islam then the Muslim authorities should be cautious of them due to their practice of taqiyyah and accordingly take precautionary measures in dealing with them How much more so if they have not repented In another fatw ā in which he mentioned the extreme kufr of the Bātiniyyah ( who include the Druze and the Nusayriyyah ) and their treacherous alliance with other kuff ār ( the crusaders and the Tatars ) against the Muslims , he said , "" Their harm upon the Ummah of Muhammad is greater than the harm of the war-waging kuff ār like the kuff ār of the Tatars , the Franks [ European crusaders ] , and others … There is no doubt that jih ād against these people and the implementation of the hud ūd upon them are from the greatest acts of obedience and obligations This is better than jih ād against those who do not fight the Muslims from the mushrik īn and Ahlul - Kit āb , for the jih ād against these people is from the jih ād against the apostates As-Sidd īq and the Companions began with the jih ād against the apostates before the jih ād against the kuff ār from Ahlul-Kit āb The jih ād against them preserves what has been conquered from the Muslims ' lands and so no one who intends to fight against the Muslims can enter these lands As for jih ād against those who have not fought us from the mushrik īn and Ahlul-Kit āb , then it is to further manifest the religion And preserving assets is a priority over making gains Also , their harm on the Muslims is greater than others ' harm Rather , their harm is like the harm of those from the mushrik īn and Ahlul-Kit āb who fight the Muslims Rather , their harm on the religion is greater than the harm of the combatants from the mushrik īn and Ahlul-Kit āb So it is obligatory upon every Muslim to attempt to do as much as he is able of this obligation against them It is not permissible for anyone to hide what he knows of their secrets Rather , he must spread them and make them public so that the Muslims know the reality of their condition It is not permissible for anyone to cooperate with them by allowing them to remain amongst the soldiers and state employees It is not permissible for anyone to be silent about establishing what Allah and His Messenger ordered against them It is not permissible for anyone to forbid the establishment of what Allah and His Messenger ordered against them This is from the greatest doors of commanding the good and forbidding the evil and jih ād for the cause of Allah "" [ Majm ū ' al-Fat āwā ] In response to the actions of the Jawl ānī front towards the Druze , a number of their allies released a combined statement in condemnation of the act Below you can read their statement : "" A Statement Regarding the Painful Event that Occurred to the People of the Village of Qalb Lawzah "" "" Allah says in the quds ī hadith , ' My slaves , I have

A month after these incidents , Labib al-Nahhas – head of foreign political relations for Ahr ār ash-Sh ām – wrote an article for the Washington Post on "" 10 July 2015 "" titled "" The Deadly Consequences of Mislabeling Syria's Revolutionaries . In it he said : "" As has become obvious , the Obama administration's response to the Syrian conflict is an abject failure … Short-term , stopgap measures informed by the Iraq and Afghanistan experiences , along with the noise generated by a media fixated on the Islamic State , have taken priority over achievable , long-term goals … Nowhere is this failure clearer than in the consequence of the misguided way that Syrian revolutionaries are labeled as either ' moderate ' or ' extremist . ' "" In December , Secretary of State John F . Kerry stated that ' Syrians should not have to choose between a tyrant and the terrorists . ' There was , Kerry declared , a third option : ' the moderate Syrian opposition who are fighting both extremists and Assad every day . ' Unfortunately , this commendable view has broken down because the United States has defined the term ' moderate ' in such a narrow and arbitrary fashion that it excludes the bulk of the mainstream opposition . "" The group to which I belong , Ahrar al-Sham , is one example Our name means ' Free Men of Syria . ' We consider ourselves a mainstream Sunni Islamic group that is led by Syrians and fights for Syrians We are fighting for justice for the Syrian people Yet we have been falsely accused of having organizational links to al-Qaeda and of espousing al-Qaeda's ideology . "" Nothing could be further from the truth We believe that Syria needs a national unifying project that cannot be controlled or delivered by a single party or group and should not be bound to a single ideology We believe in striking a balance that respects the legitimate aspirations of the majority as well as protects minority communities and enables them to play a real and positive role in Syria's future We believe in a moderate future for Syria that preserves the state and institutes reforms that benefit all Syrians … Syrians consider us an integral , valued element of the revolutionary landscape , yet we have been unfairly vilified by the Obama administration from Day One . "" Stuck inside their own bubble , White House policymakers have allocated millions of U . S . taxpayer dollars to support failed CIA efforts to support so-called ' moderate ' forces in Syria But these ' moderate ' groups have proved to be a disappointment on nearly every count , not least of all in confronting the Islamic State Further , the self-defeating policy of regarding the war against the Islamic State as being fundamentally different from , and in some cases diametrically opposed to , efforts to remove Assad from power has brought no end to either battle . "" The moral case against Assad should have been enough to discount him as an option , but now the facts of war have made it clear that he is finished The only remaining question is who will deliver the coup de grace : the Islamic State or the Syrian opposition That question should prompt Washington to admit that the Islamic State's extremist ideology can be defeated only through a homegrown Sunni alternative — with the term ' moderate ' defined not by CIA handlers but by Syrians themselves . "" Despite a disappointing lack of genuine engagement from the international community , we remain committed to dialogue The issues that need to be discussed are how to end Assad's reign , how to defeat the Islamic State and how to ensure that a stable and representative government in Damascus puts Syria on the path to peace , reconciliation and economic recovery while avoiding the disintegration of the state It is not too late for the United States to change course ""Kerry's ' third option ' exists — but only if Washington is willing to open its eyes and see it . So he disavows "" al-Qaeda "" and its so-called "" ideology "" and announces they are willing to cooperate openly now with the crusaders against the Islamic State after almost two years of indirect cooperation through their tāghūt allies And this faction was supposedly the most "" Islamic "" faction according to the Jawl ānī front , who themselves aided them against the Islamic State despite their extreme deviance May Allah divide the hearts of the various factions in the Sahwah Coalition until the violence amongst them becomes extremely severe And may Allah expose the hypocrisy , duplicity , and deviance of the jih ād claimants "

Similarly , they were forbidden from pronouncing takf īr upon the "" Free Syrian Army "" ( FSA ) He witnessed how he himself as well as the Islamic State were strongly criticized for this There were also many situations in which the law of Allah was violated by the local factions ; the people weren't being judged by the Shar ī ' ah In one of these cases , for example , a local person insulted Allah ( ta ' ālā ) and did not receive punishment for his crime While he was with Jun ūd ash-Sh ām , he was joined by his best friend Abū Luqm ān al-Alm ānī and Abū Junaydah's cousin Abū Hafs al-Alm ānī in order to wage jih ād against the taw āghīt everywhere and their allies But Abū Luqm ān and Abū Hafs did not stay long with Jun ūd ash-Sh ām , as they quickly recognized the corrupt and deviant manhaj of the faction and understood that they should join the Jam ā ' ah Thus they both gave bay'ah to Amīrul - Mu'min īn Abū Bakr al-Husayn ī al-Baghd ādī ( hafidhahull āh ) , joining the Islamic State On the day of the Sahwah treachery , Abū Luqm ān and Abū Hafs were captured by the FSA and imprisoned with hundreds of other muh ājirīn But they deceived their captors into releasing them This led them to meet Abū Junaydah again , who had abandoned Jun ūd ash-Sh ām for the Jawl ānī front shortly before the Sahwah He began to work in the Jawl ānī front's media department Because of Abū Sulaym ān the Australian's lies , Abū Junaydah had some misconceptions about the Islamic State , but his heart was longing to join the Jam ā ' ah , to be on its side while the whole world had assembled against it militarily , politically , economically , and even in the media realm He also began catching many contradictions in the claims of Abū Sulaym ān the Australian and his Sahwah comrades against the Islamic State In addition to this , Abū Hafs – who was stuck in Halab after his release from the early Sahwah prisons – would regularly advise Abū Junaydah to join the Islamic State "

1,"Sex and Women It is the first necessity for reproduction and preservation of a species It is a preoccupation of men and women alike It is the driving instinct of males Sex is used to sell everything from automobiles to zircons It is a woman's power and a man's curse It is the catalyst in the "" Battle of the Sexes . It both unites and divides , bringing both pleasure and pain It unleashes emotion too powerful for logic or reason to control , yet it is vital to life It is a misused tool of merchants , priestcrafters and statecrafters Without a natural outlet a misdirected sex drive can lead to all manner of neurosis and conflict Sex is perhaps the single most important subject that those who struggle for the life of our people should understand Yet , due to centuries of mind-poisoning from alien religions , most are unable to discuss sex with total frankness But the taboo must be broken The question begs to be asked , "" Is the natural way and the upward path even possible in the modern , industrialized world ? Self-evidently the natural way and the upward path are impossible within nation-states ruled by those dedicated to the mixing and extermination of the race which created so - called "" Western Civilization . In olden times a woman taught her daughters , "" Tis far better to be mistress of a king than wife of a servant . Of course , in those days , kingship was determined by valor and other valuable genetic traits , like cunning and determination So , a woman knew that if her children were sired by a king , or other nobility , the chances were greater that her offspring would develop into exceptional individuals In this foul age , when the kings of the earth are usurers , word-twisters and degenerates , the olden ways do not apply The systems under which we live are craftily constructed so that the White folk who obey the instincts given them by nature find that obedience to authority , to law , to religious precepts or to sociably acceptable mores is racial suicide And by nature , most Aryans are not anarchists In the cold climes of the North , social cooperation was necessary for survival When living exclusively among our own kind with benevolent leaders , acceptance of higher authority was then our greatest strength Conversely , however , in a multi-racial society , ruled by Zionists , acceptance of authority is the Achilles heel of our race It leads us to fraternal wars , acceptance of genocidal practices like forced bussing and the insanity of a statement like , "" My country , right or wrong ! Because we are by nature an open and honest people , we assume that others are like us And this makes us the most gullible race on the earth The minds of the masses are almost exactly analogous to blank computer disks which can be programmed however the operator desires Years ago I was with Bob Mathews in a large city We saw a White girl get off a bus ;

Whether that means polygamy is decreed by nature is a subject for legitimate debate That strong and lasting bonds are often formed in monogamous pairing is evident Equally evident is that social systems of the last two centuries and the last two millennia have been disastrous for the Aryan race In the final analysis we must remember that allowing the meddlers of Church or State to dictate sexual relationships or marital affairs opens doors to endless tyranny Decisions must be made by individuals , based on personal circumstances , folkish needs , common sense and the conditions imposed by external factors of the age True Aryan men , of course , recognize their duty to provide for and protect their wives and children By conditioning and false intellectualization the modern woman convinces herself she should "" own "" one man , rather than be the possession of a superior man But the fire fades The spark dies Her orgasms are weak and faked Because once a man is "" tamed , "" the natural attraction is gone He is now her working drone , she no longer needs to compete with other women In her heart of hearts she despises "" her man , "" while her innermost being longs to be taken by a dominant male Her sexual nature is sublimated and she adopts any false and destructive doctrine that captures her attention Preachers and anti-nature religion become her substitute masters Jewelry , make-up , possessions , universalist social causes become obsessions Mindless sophistries turned to slogans become her code of life Cats and dogs substitute for children Her instincts are denied One only has to look at the groupies who flock around rock stars , movie stars and sports figures to see that the instincts given by nature never change These groupies know full well they are but one of many in the virtual harem of such public figures Degenerate though these figures may be , they are perceived as extraordinary by the groupies who desire them Part of the Battle of the Sexes is a woman's need to be recognized as valuable In the natural world , that means first of all sex appeal , especially for young women A woman is in competition with other women The book "" Might is Right "" proclaims that women dislike and distrust each other intensely Women authors have written the same thing Whether true or not , the competition is real Men lust for women Women in turn can meet the competition of other women by sharpening their "" weapons of war "" or by attempting to "" tame "" a man The former is good , the latter she will inevitably try in this unnatural age , to her material benefit but sexual frustration A man cherishes what he desires and for which he has labored or struggled to attain While there are exceptions to most rules , a man does not mistreat that which he cherishes So a wise woman keeps herself desirable Virtually all White women are blessed with natural beauty and attraction Aryan women keep their beauty until late in life if they keep fit Inevitably youthful beauty fades with age , no one can change that , but there is no greater treasure to a man than a woman old enough to be a companion , yet with the discipline to keep herself attractive Hopefully men having such a woman will appreciate her Women should not be deceived that jew-elry makes them attractive , neither does nail polish , pancake make-up , fancy hair styling or gaudy clothes These artificial devices serve to enrich Jewish coffers , and as an ill-conceived attempt to impress or depress other women Nature made sex enjoyable to ensure propagation and preservation of the species Men without the courage to fight for women , either as individuals or as a race , do not deserve the pleasure of sex Because of the long time it takes to rear and nurture our offspring , nature made sex a pleasure even when not specifically for conception , so enjoy The alien religions made "" sex is sin "" a major part of their doctrine They made it the insane idea of "" original sin , "" because sex is unavoidable for survival of the race Priestcrafters needed an unavoidable "" sin "" from which to "" save "" the sheeple It is all a lie Sex is both duty and pleasure In our indigenous religions sex was elevated to the status of a sacrament The marital or sexual affairs or arrangements of the folk are not the business of government or guilt-laying priests Bear in mind that the primal law and moral absolute is preservation of one's own kind and it will provide a guide to proper sexual mores Then enter the Battle of the Sexes with all the joy that competition is meant to bring "
1,"Until the White race realizes that there is only one source from which we can ascertain lasting truths , there will never be peace or stability on this earth In the immutable Laws of Nature are the keys to life , order , and understanding The words of men , even those which some consider "" inspired "" are subject to the translations , vocabulary , additions , subtractions , and distortions of fallible mortals Therefore , every writing or influence , ancient or modern , must be strained through the test of conformity to Natural Law The White Peoples of the earth must collectively understand that they are equally subject to the iron-hard Laws of Nature with every other creature of the Universe , or they will not secure peace , safety , nor even their existence The world is in flames because Races , Sub-races , Nations , and Cultures are being forced to violate their own Nature - ordained instincts for self-preservation Many men of good will , but little understanding , are struggling against symptoms which are the result of disobedience to Natural Law As is the Nature of man , most take narrow , provincial stances predicated on views formed by immediate environment , current circumstances , and conditioned dogma This is encouraged by that powerful and ruthless Tribe which has controlled the affairs of the world for untold centuries by exploiting Man's most base instincts Conflict among and between the unenlightened serves as their mask and shield A deeper understanding of the Fundamental Laws that govern the affairs of Men is necessary if we are to save civilization from its usurious executioners These few pages are not intended to provide a detailed system of government , but as PRECEPTS which , when understood , will benefit and preserve a People as individuals and as a Nation Any religion or teaching which denies the Natural Laws of the Universe is false Whatever People's perception of God , or Gods , or the motive Force of the Universe might be , they can hardly deny that Nature's Law are the work of , and therefore the intent of , that Force God and religion are distinct , separate and often conflicting concepts Nature evidences the divine plan , for the natural world is the work of the force or the intelligence men call God Religion is the creation of mortals , therefore predestined to fallibility Religion may preserve or destroy a People , depending on the structure given by its progenitors , the motives of its agents and the vagaries of historical circumstances The truest form of prayer is communion with Nature It is not vocal Go to a lonely spot , if possible a mountaintop , on a clear , star-lit night , ponder the majesty and order of the infinite macrocosm Then consider the intricacies of the equally infinite microcosm Understand that you are on the one hand inconsequential beyond comprehension in the size of things , and on the other hand , you are potentially valuable beyond comprehension as a link in destiny's chain There you begin to understand how pride and self can co-exist with respect and reverence There we find harmony with Nature and with harmony comes strength , peace and certainty Secular power systems protect and promote religions , which teach of an after-life Thus , people are taught to abandon defenses against the predators of this life History , both secular and religious , is a fable conceived in self-serving deceit and promulgated by those who perceive benefits Religion in its most beneficial form is the symbology of a People and their culture A multi - racial religion destroys the senses of uniqueness , exclusivity and value necessary to the survival of a race What men call the "" super natural "" is actually the "" natural "" not yet understood or revealed A proliferation of laws with the resultant loss of freedom is a sign of , and directly proportional to , spiritual sickness in a Nation If a Nation is devoid of spiritual health and moral character , then government and unprincipled men will fill the vacancy Therefore , freedom prospers in moral values and tyranny thrives in moral decay Truth requires little explanation Therefore , beware of verbose doctrines The great principles are revealed in brevity Truth does not fear investigation Unfounded belief is pitfall A People who do not check the validity and effect of their beliefs with reason will suffer or perish In accord with Nature's Laws , nothing is more right than the preservation of one's own race No greater motivating force exists than the certain conviction that one is right Discernment is a sign of a healthy People In a sick or dying nation , civilization , culture or race , substance is abandoned in favor of appearance Discernment includes the ability to recognize the difference between belief and demonstrable reality There exists no such thing as rights or privileges under the Laws of Nature The deer being stalked by a hungry lion has no right to life However , he may purchase life by obedience to nature - ordained instincts for vigilance and flight Similarly , men have no rights to life , liberty or happiness These circumstances may be purchased by oneself , by one's family , by one's tribe or by one's ancestors , but they are nonetheless purchases and are not rights Furthermore , the value of these purchases can only be maintained through vigilance and obedience to Natural Law A people who are not convinced of their uniqueness and value will perish The White race has suffered invasions and brutality from Africa and Asia for thousands of years For example , Attila and the Asiatic Huns who invaded Europe in the 5th century , raping , plundering and killing from the Alps to the Baltic and the Caspian Seas This scenario was repeated by the Mongols of Genghis Khan 800 years later ( Note here that the American Indians are not "" Native Americans , "" but are racially Mongolians . In the 8th century , hundreds of years before Negroes were brought to America , the North African Moors of mixed racial background invaded and conquered Portugal , Spain and part of France So , the attempted guilt-trip placed on the White race by civilization's executioners is invalid under both historical circumstance and the Natural Law which denies inter - specie compassion The fact is , all races have benefited immeasurably from the creative genius of the Aryan People People who allow others not of their race to live among them will perish , because the inevitable result of a racial integration is racial inter-breeding which destroys the characteristics and existence of a race Forced integration is deliberate and malicious genocide , particularly for a People like the White race , who are now a small minority in the world In the final analysis , a race or specie is not judged superior or inferior by its accomplishments , but by its will and ability to survive Political , economic , and religious systems may be destroyed and resurrected by men , but the death of a race is eternal No race of People can indefinitely continue their existence without territorial imperatives in which to propagate , protect , and promote their own kind A People without a culture exclusively their own will perish Nature has put a certain antipathy between races and species to preserve the individuality and existence of each Violation of the territorial imperative necessary to preserve that antipathy leads to either conflict or mongrelization It is not constructive to hate those of other races , or even those of mixed races But a separation must be maintained for the survival of one's own race One must , however , hate with a pure and perfect hatred those of one's own race who commit treason against one's own kind and against the nations of one's own kind One must hate with perfect hatred all those People or practices which destroy one's People , one's culture , or the racial exclusiveness of one's territorial imperative The concept of a multi-racial society violates every Natural Law for specie preservation The concept of "" equality "" is declared a lie by every evidence of Nature It is a search for the lowest common denominator , and its pursuit will destroy every superior race , nation , or culture In order for a plow horse to run as fast as a race horse you would first have to cripple the race horse ; conversely , in order for a race horse to pull as much as a plow horse , you would first have to cripple the plow horse In either case , the pursuit of equality is the destruction of excellence The instincts for racial and specie preservation are ordained by Nature Instincts are Nature's perfect mechanism for the survival of each race and specie The human weakness of rationalizing situations for self-gratification must not be permitted to interfere with these instincts Miscegenation , that is race-mixing , is and has always been , the greatest threat to the survival of the Aryan race Inter-specie compassion is contrary to the Laws of Nature and is , therefore , suicidal If a wolf were to intercede to save a lamb from a lion , he would be killed Today , we see the White man taxed so heavily that he cannot afford children The taxes raised are then used to support the breeding of tens of millions of non-whites , many of whom then demand the last White females for breeding partners As you can see , man is subject to all the Laws of Nature This has nothing to do with morality , hatred , good or evil Nature does not recognize the concepts of good and evil in inter-specie relationships If the lion eats the lamb , it is good for the lion and evil for the lamb If the lamb escapes and the lion starves , it is good for the lamb and evil for the lion So , we see the same incident is labeled both good and evil This cannot be , for there are no contradictions within Nature's Laws The instinct for sexual union is part of Nature's perfect mechanism for specie preservation It begins early in life and often continues until late in life It must not be repressed ; its purpose , reproduction , must not be thwarted either Understand that for thousands of years our females bore children at an early age Now , in an attempt to conform to and compete in an alien culture , they deny their Nature - ordained instincts and duties Teach responsibility , but , also , have understanding The life of a race springs from the wombs of its women He who would judge must first understand the difference between what is good and what is right Homosexuality is a crime against Nature All Nature declares the purpose of the instinct for sexual union is reproduction and thus , preservations of the specie The overpowering male sex drive must be channeled toward possession of females , as well as elements such as territory and power , which are necessary to keep them Sexual pornography degrades the Nature of all who are involved A beautiful nude woman is art ; a camera between her knees to explore her private parts is pornography That race whose males will not fight to death to keep and mate with their females will perish Any White man with healthy instincts feels disgust and revulsion when he sees a woman of his race with a man of another race Those , who today control the media and affairs of the Western World , teach that this is wrong and shameful They label it "" racism . As any "" ism , "" for instance the word "" nationalism , "" means to promote one's own nation ; "" racism "" merely means to promote and protect the life of one's own race It is , perhaps , the proudest word in existence Any man who disobey these instincts is anti-Nature In a sick and dying nation , culture , race or civilization , political dissent and traditional values will be labeled and persecuted as heinous crimes by inquisitors clothing themselves in jingoistic patriotism A People who are ignorant of their past will defile the present and destroy the future A race must honor above all earthly things , those who have given their lives or freedom for the preservation of the folk The folk , namely the members of the race , are the Nation Racial loyalties must always supersede geographical and national boundaries If this is taught and understood , it will end fratricidal wars Wars must not be fought for the benefit of another race The Nations ' leaders are not rulers , they are servants and guardians They are not to serve for personal gain Choose only a guardian who has no interest in the accumulation of material things Choose and judge your leaders , also called guardians , thus : Those who seek always to limit the power of government are of good heart and conscience Those who seek to expand the power of government are base tyrants No government can give anything to anybody without first taking it from another Government is , by its very nature , legalized taking A limited amount of government is a necessary burden for national defense and internal order Anything more is counter-productive to freedom and liberty The Organic founding Law , namely the Constitution of a Nation , must not be amendable by any method other than unanimous consent of all parties thereto and with all parties present Otherwise , the doors are opened for the advent of that most dangerous and deadly form of government , democracy In a democracy those who control the media , and thus the minds of the electorate , have power undreamed by kings or dictators The simplest way to describe a democracy is this : Three people form a government , each having one vote Then two of them vote to steal the wealth of the third The latter stages of a democracy are filled with foreign wars , because the bankrupt system attempts to preserve itself by plundering other nations In a democracy that which is legal is seldom moral , and that which is moral is often illegal A democracy is always followed by a strongman ... some call him dictator It is the only way to restore order out of the chaos caused by a democracy Pick your strongman wisely He must be a guardian in his heart He must be one who has shown that his only purpose in life is the preservation of the folk His ultimate aim must be to restore the rule of Law based on the perfect Laws of Nature Do not choose him by his words Choose one who has sacrificed all in the face of tyranny ; choose one who has endured and persevered This is the only reliable evidence of his worthiness and motives A power system will do anything , no matter how corrupt or brutal , to preserve itself Tyrannies cannot be ended without the use of force Those who commit treason disguise their deeds in proclamations of patriotism Propaganda is major component in all power systems , both secular and religious ; false propaganda is a major component of unprincipled power systems All power systems endeavor to convince their subjects that the system is good , just , beneficent and noble , as well as worthy of perpetuation and defense The more jingoistic propaganda issued , the more suspicious one should be of its truth Political power , in the final analysis , is created and maintained by force A power system , secular or religious , which employs extensive calls to patriotism or requires verbosity and rhetoric for its preservation , is masking tyranny Propaganda is a legitimate and necessary weapon in any struggle The elements of successful propaganda are : simplicity , emotion , repetition , and brevity Also , since men believe what they want to believe , and since they want to believe that which they perceive as beneficial to themselves , then successful propaganda must appeal to the perceived self-interest of those to whom it is disseminated Tyrannies teach what to think ; free men learn how to think Beware of men who increase their wealth by the use of words Particularly beware of the lawyers or priests who deny Natural Law The patriot , being led to the inquisition's dungeons or the executioner's axe , will be condemned the loudest by his former friends and allies ; for thus they seek to escape the same fate The sweet goddess of Peace lives only under the protective arm of the ready God of War The organic founding Law of a Nation must state with unmistakable and irrevocable specificity the identity of the homogeneous racial , cultural group for whose welfare it was formed , and that the continued existence of the Nation is singularly for all time for the welfare of that specific group only That race or culture which lets others influence or control any of the following will perish : Organs of information ; Educational institutions ; Religious institutions ; Political offices ; Creation of their money ; Judicial institutions ; Cultural institutions ; Economic life Just Laws require little explanation Their meaning is irrevocable in simplicity and specificity ""Men's emotions are stirred far more effectively by the spoken word than by the written word This is why a ruling tyranny will react more violently to gatherings of dissenters than to books or pamphlets The organic founding Law of the Nation , or any law , is exactly as pertinent as the will and power to enforce it An unarmed or non-militant People will be enslaved Some say the pen is more powerful than the sword Perhaps so Yet , the pen without the sword has no authority Tyrannies are usually built step by step and disguised by noble rhetoric The difference between a terrorist and a patriot is control of the press The judgments of the guardians , the leaders , must be true to Natural Law and tempered by reason Materialism is base and destructive The guardians of a Nation must constantly warn against and combat a materialistic spirit in the Nation Acquisition of wealth and property , as need for the well - being of one's family and obtained by honorable means is right and proper Exploitation , particularly through usury , is destructive to a nation Materialism leads men to seek artificial status through wealth or property True social status comes from service to Family , Race and Nation Materialism ultimately leads to conspicuous , unnecessary consumption , which in turn leads to the rape of Nature and destruction of the environment It is unnatural The true guardians of the Nation must be wholly untainted by materialism The function of a merchant or salesman is to provide a method of exchange A merchant who promotes unnecessary consumption and materialism must not be tolerated The only lawful functions of money are as a medium of exchange and especially usury are unlawful Usury ( interest ) at any percentage is a high crime which cannot be tolerated A nation with an aristocracy of money , lawyers or merchants will become a tyranny The simplest way to describe a usury-based central banking system is this : The bankers demand the property of the Nation as collateral for their loans At interest , more money is owed them that they created with the loans So , eventually , the bankers foreclose on the Nation Usury ( interest ) , inflation , and oppressive taxation are the theft by deception and destroy the moral fabric of the Nation Wealth gained without sacrifices or honest labor will usually be misused Nothing in Nature is static ; either the life force grows and expands or it decays and dies Respect must be earned ; it cannot be demanded or assumed Avoid a vexatious man , for his venom will poison your own nature Self discipline is a mark of higher man One measure of a man is cheerfulness in adversity A fool judges others by their words A wise man judges others by their actions and accomplishments In our relationships or interactions , as in all of Nature's Laws , to each action there is a reaction That which we plant will be harvested , if not by ourselves , then by another These are sure signs of a sick or dying Nation If you see any of them , your guardians are committing treason Mixing and destruction of the founding race ; Destruction of the family units ; Oppressive taxation ; Corruption of the Law ; Terror and suppression against those who warn of the Nation's error ; Immorality : drugs , drunkenness , etc ; Infanticide ( now called abortion ); Destruction of the currency ( inflation or usury ); Aliens in the land , alien culture ; Materialism ; Foreign wars ; Guardians ( leaders ) who pursue wealth or glory ; Homosexuality ; Religion not based on Natural Law "
1,"Praise be to the One who said : ﴾ And do not may peace and blessings be upon His Messenger say about those who are killed in the way of Allah , "" They are dead . Rather , they are alive , but you perceive [ it ] not ﴿ [ 2 : 154 ] And who said : "" In the name of whom the soul of Muhammad is in His hands , I wish I could fight in the path of Allah and then be killed and then fight and be killed and then fight and be killed . Today we say our farewells to Abu Ayman al-Masri , Bakr bin Sa ` eed Muhammad Numaan , a hero of our ummah and one of its knights , who passed away in the land of Aden-Abyan A man who has stood against the tyrants of the Arabian Peninsula and whom the apostate media has announced his death several times after every failed operation led by their armies , and yet Allah would protect his servant Abu Ayman and expose the lies of the government media But now Abu Ayman had an appointment with martyrdom , a status that he'd strive to reach for a long time Abu Ayman was one of the members of the Jihad Movement in the city of Bani Suwaif in Egypt He left Egypt to flee the persecution of the tyrant Hosni Mubarak spending some time in Sudan and Jordan before settling in Yemen where he worked with his brothers including Abu al-Hassan al-Mihdar , may Allah have mercy upon him He stayed in Marib , in Husun Âl Jal âl and was a companion of Shaykh Abu Ali al-Harithi , may Allah have mercy on him He was with Abu Ali when the military sent forces from the Republican Guard to Marib in order to capture the mujahidin The Republican Guard forces were defeated and their commander was killed and a few of their armored vehicles were destroyed Then he and Abu Ali al-Harithi moved to al-Jawf During a trip with Shaykh Abu Ali between Marib and Shabwa , a U . S . drone fired a missile on the vehicle killing Abu Ali and some of his brothers Abu Ayman and a few other brothers were not harmed as they were in another vehicle In the following stage of the jihad of Abu Ayman , he helped with the travel arrangements for those brothers that wanted to join the mujahidin in Afghanistan , Iraq , Somalia , and Algeria When the twenty three brothers broke out of the Political Security Prison in Sana'a , he hosted a group of them in his house becoming a muh âjir and an anşârî at the same time Abu Ayman carried upon his shoulders the effort to re-establish the al Qaeda organization He took advantage of the escape of the brothers from prison to contact the brothers that he knew and in doing so , he visited me to ask if I would join hands and help the brothers who left jail and who were going through difficult circumstances and were being continuously pursued by the security forces Allah made it possible for me to meet brother Abu Ayman again in his house At that time Shaykh Abu Basir , Abu Hurairah and Gharib al-Taizi were staying with him and we began the necessary arrangements for the establishment of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula Abu Ayman was a generous brother with an outstanding character He was in the service of his brothers He was forgiving and would not turn down a request from any of his brothers He was like a father for them and would always guide and provide them with advice He was courageous and was known for asking his brothers to allow him to per form a martyrdom operation That was his love for Allah and his desire to fight the enemies of Allah His opinion was invaluable to his brothers Through his efforts , he brought the brothers together under the leadership of Abu Basir in an effort to bring an end to disunity He lived off of a farm where he worked hard to support his family In the first days of the work , he would even support his brothers I have seen from this brother something that I would rarely find in anyone else He would leave his house for his brothers to stay in to protect them , and he and his family would sleep in the yard regardless of the hot weather or sand storms He did this for months even though he had young kids and Shaykh Abu Basir , Abu Hurairah , Gharib and myself would stay indoors His house not only hosted us but before us was the place where Shaykh Abu Ali and Hamza al-Qiyadi , may Allah have mercy upon them , would stay He would sacrifice anything for the sake his brothers Since he was organizing the communications for the mujahidin , news reached us that his house would be bombed to get rid of him We had to leave his house and he left with us to arrange for a new place to stay Abu Ayman had a wide circle of acquaintances with many Yemeni tribes and was very much liked by them He used to deal with them with their own customs and spoke their dialects He was kind towards his neighbors When the news of his martyrdom reached them he was mourned by their men , women and children He participated in many operations against the apostates and crusaders He was part of the USS Cole and Lindberg operations and was the Amir of the battle of Marib His participation was present in many other operations He was also one of the commanders in Abyan When the brothers succeeded in taking Zinjibar , the capital of Abyan , they laid siege to the "" Gulf 20 "" soccer stadium and succeeded in taking it after clearing the forces based in it The stadium was taken in order to complete the siege of the 25th Mechanized battalion which is a main battalion of the Yemeni army This is when forces came together to prevent the fall of Aden from the hands of the mujahidin The mujahidin brothers succeeded in turning back five attacks by the army , killing many soldiers in the process and taking huge caches of booty The support of Allah for the mujahidin was clear During one attack , six mujahidin armed only with their AK - 47s succeeded in disabling 2 tanks and a few vehicles and single-handedly turned back the military convey after Allah struck fear into their hearts The soldiers fled the battleground leaving their weapons behind them Allah says : ﴾ You did not kill them but it was Allah who killed them ﴿ [8 : 17 ] And Allah says : ﴾ And how many of a small band defeated a large band by the will of Allah ﴿ [ 2 : 249 ] And Allah says : ﴾ If Allah grants you victory no one can defeat you ﴿ [ 3 : 160 ] Allah is with His mujahidin servants : ﴾ And those who strive in Us , We will guide them to our paths and Allah is with the good doers ﴿ [ 29 : 69 ] I met Abu Ayman in the front line of Dawfas in Abyan and spent a few days with him He was disheveled and covered in dust He would take shade under thorny trees in the very hot summer of the Yemeni coast He would plan with his brothers and organize his soldiers I found him teaching the brothers how to use the artillery guns that were taken as booty from the army He was continuously moving from place to place and whenever I would head somewhere I would find him ahead of me Even though he was gentle and kind , in the battlefield he was strict and firm In his home I knew him to be very kind and humble and in the service of his brothers , and I saw him in the battlefield as a lion of courage with a presence that radiates steadfastness in whoever is around him An American-Saudi-Yemeni coalition force launched a land , air and sea attack in which Abu Ayman fought them courageously I met with Shaykh Ibrahim al-Rubaish and he told me that he met Abu Ayman two hours before his martyrdom Abu Ayman was smiling and he asked some brothers to join him in going to the front line One of the brothers had a white T-shirt on so Abu Ayman told him to stay back because the color of his T-shirt would stand out and give away their location Instead of staying back , the brother took off his T-shirt and joined In the battle , Abu Ayman was struck by machine gun fire from a helicopter May Allah shower him with His mercy and grant him paradise Abu Ayman was a shûrâ ' member of the al Qaeda Organization in the Arabian Peninsula He was one of those brothers who were carrying the organization on their shoulders with patience and sincerity We miss you O Abu Ayman and we only say what pleases Allah We all belong to Allah and we will all return to Him We witness that you have fulfilled your duty so sleep comfortably until we meet in Paradise by the will of Allah May peace be upon your soul amongst the eternal "
1,"Ali Sa'eed Hussain Jameel , better known as Muwahid , was the humble friend we all came to know and love His regular interest in his brothers and hospitality towards them quickly made him one of the most beloved of the Anşâr He was hard working and always busy in reconnaissance work as well as military operations against the army of shirk He was also a prominent figure in the ranks of da ` wah , calling the people to taw ĥîd and jihad Muwahid – may Allah have mercy upon him – joined al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in its early stages Because of his hospitality , he became one of the pivots in the movement , providing major support to the brothers His house was always open to the brothers , thus making it one of the most significant mujahidin shelters Because of this , the leaders of apostasy in Yemen placed him on their most wanted list But that didn't bother this bold lion , for his heart was only concerned about success in the next life ; meeting with the Prophet and resting in al-Firdaus al - ` Alâ for eternity When I first met Muwahid , he struck me as a very down-to-earth individual although he was large and well-built A brother introduced me to him as one of those that took part in the battle for Ma'rib He was the first person I met that took part in that event It was after the battle of Ma'rib that the name of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula gave the murtad în nightmares Muwahid was one of the brothers that helped attack an enemy's convoy before the battle The battle then commenced when the apostates surrounded the house of Aaidh al-Shabwani , may Allah have mercy upon him He lived a simple life and chose the possessions of the âkhira over the duny â ' s He was a mu'min that had wonder ful qualities such as good humor , piety and courage He would never speak ill of his brothers and sought to make those around him happy He was an outstanding poet and had written quite a few poems that were later sung and recorded as nash îd ' s by the mujahidin If there was ever a problem between the brothers , he was the quickest to quell it by taking the brother ( s ) to the side and advising them humbly Nearly everyday , if he had the chance , he would exercise for a few hours ; staying in good shape was important to him seeing that jihad is hard on the body He loved to spend his time with Islamic books to gain knowledge but because most of his time was spent traveling around for the jihad , he was unable to pursue that as much as he wanted Muwahid was the Amir of Ma'rib for a number of years until his role changed He later played a major part in the opening of Abyan He was specialized in shooting mortars and had marksmanship He took part in many battles and usually played the role of an Amir His knowledge of weaponry , guerilla war fare and Yemen's landscape was exemplary He was martyred with other brothers in Abyan when the murtad în attacked them We ask Allah to accept Muwahid amongst the shuhad â ' "
1,"May Allah's mercy overshadow you O Aaidh You have proven to the mujahidin your allegiance and love for Islam May Allah be pleased with you You have confirmed the path of the Prophets through your actions and were willing to die upon that when the armies of godlessness and despotism were in pursuit of you He was Aaidh Saleh Muhammad Jabir al - ` Abeedi from Ma'rib His house was where the famous battle of Ma'rib took place in which many tanks surrounded it and a countless number of apostate soldiers bombarded it With the help of Allah alone and trust in Him , Aaidh and seven other brothers disfigured their ranks , bringing devastation to the army of apostasy Aaidh quickly became one of the most wanted mujahidin in Yemen due to his harboring of the people of paradise in Ma'rib Because of people like him , al Qaeda in Yemen Aaidh singing a nash îd with Fawaz on a mujahid's wedding took off with great force and speed Aaidh was always found doing either of two things : conversing with his brothers or remembering Allah He lived such a simple life and dedicated it wholly to Allah , The Exalted He , may Allah have mercy upon him , took part in many battles and fought ferociously despite having a limping problem in his right leg He always maintained a positive attitude with it and never expressed any dissatisfaction In battle , no matter the conditions , he never tired and was always able to adapt to his circumstances His patience was meritorious for he was able to fight in battles for very long periods of time When I first came to Yemen , the brothers would relate to me stories of Aaidh and the miraculous battle of Ma'rib He was a brother I yearned to meet One time while sitting with a few mujahidin and discussing some issues , a brother came and sat before me I never met him before He was small in stature but great in akhl âq He was always smiling and continously welcomed me to Yemen After an hour or so , one of the brothers turned to me and asked , "" Do you know who this brother is ? I looked at him and said , "" No , I don't have a clue . All of the brothers laughed "" This is Aaidh al-Shabwani . My mouth dropped and I was in shock One of the most dangerous and important figures of the jihad in Yemen was sitting right before me , smiling humbly I didn't know what to say except to thank him for his efforts of supporting the mujahidin He was always on the frontlines during the battle for Abyan He was martyred when a military helicopter belonging to the army of al-Aswad al-Ansi rained bullets of infidelity upon him and his brothers , killing him instantly Aaidh was loved greatly by the brothers and losing him was like losing a family member We ask Allah to accept him "
1,"One day , while together on a military exercise , a Major from 1 Frontier Force Regiment of Pakistan Army showed me his diary It was a meticulously crafted personal notebook but what really intrigued me was a list on its initial pages The list contained the names of all the commanding officers of 1 Frontier Force Regiment in a chronological order and to my surprise ; the list was dating back to the year 1757 This was the year when British East India Company captured Bengal in a major battle against the Muslim ruler Nawab Siraj-ud-Daulah at Plassey "" So , your Battalion fought against the Muslims in 1757 ? I asked the Major A glitter of pride appeared in his eyes , "" Yes , and the British government and military acknowledge our services till today ! Sadly , the Major of Pakistan's Army was telling the truth Many of the battalions of Pakistan's Army have continued to exist since British occupation of India In those days , about 80 % troops of the Royal Indian Army were Indians but commanded by the British officers One cannot resist appreciating the cunning of the British , how smartly they subdued the Indian population using the soldiers recruited from the very same population The Muslim rule in India ended in 1857 , exactly 100 years after the battle of Plassey , with the British East India Company taking over control of most of India This defeat could be attributed to the indulgence of Muslim rulers in the worldly pleasures and divergence from the Islamic shari ` ah , but surely the Royal Indian Army played an important role in bringing victory to the British The unequivocal loyalty and subordination of today's Pakistani Army to the anti-Muslim Crusader alliance may surprise some people but it is a historical fact that the troops from this area have always been loyal to the British and were especially instrumental in undermining the independence movement by other Indians in 1857 The forefathers of present day's Pakistan Army under the leadership of British commander Brigadier General John Nicholson were mobilized from North Western India ( present day Pakistan ) to fight against Indian freedom fighters who were trying to restore the authority of the Muslim Mughal Emperor in Delhi After 1857 , the forefathers of the present day Pakistan Army have also fought against the Muslims under the leadership of the British in the second Afghan war ( 1878-80 ) as well as in the First and Second World Wars Participation of these so-called "" Muslim troops "" in the First World War is of great importance as they helped the British abolish the Islamic Caliphate completely for the first time in the 1400 year history of Islam These "" Muslim troops "" participating in the World Wars were strongly supported by pro-British "" Muslim "" politicians such as Muhammad Ali Jinnah , the man who was to later become the founder of Pakistan British rule in India officially ended after the Second World War ( 1939-1945 ) and the status of "" superpower "" on the global stage was transferred to the United States of America Pakistan was soon created after the Second World War in 1947 and the Royal Indian Army was also divided into an Indian and Pakistani Army The partition of India was solely in British and Americans ' interest but the Pakistani Muslims were deceived into believing that the aim of Pakistan's creation was to establish Islamic shari ` ah in the newly acquired piece of land After the partition , politicians and military Generals loyal to the West showed their true color and instead of implementing Islamic shari ` ah , they decided to rule the new country according to the same old British colonial laws Alternatively the Pakistan Army , with the financial , political and military support of its American and British masters , actively seized any attempt to implement the shari ` ah in Pakistan , thus causing great difficulties for Pakistani Muslims in the last 63 years Even today , the Pakistan Army's battalions of British ancestry are not shy of boasting about their loyalties to the British masters A notorious battalion of Pakistan's Army called Guides Cavalry still wears a red piping on their collars to commemorate the wounding of their officers by the Indian freedom fighters ( referred to as mutineers by the British ) during the war of Indian Independence The Pakistani Army is not just restricted to covert means to keep its grip on the Muslims of Pakistan , but these blood thirsty rogues are ready to spill any amount of innocent blood if their evil rule is challenged The numbers of Muslims murdered by Pakistan's Army in the last 63 years are hard to estimate but they can easily run in the millions These acts of mass murder , not only include the present day killings in the tribal areas , Swat and Islamabad but also the genocide of Muslims in East Pakistan ( now Bangladesh ) in 1971 The Chief of Army Staff General Yahya Khan who was also the president of Pakistan at that time , ordered the army to massacre the Bengali Muslims ; additionally , countless of Muslim women were raped This killing spree finally ended with a humiliating surrender of 93,000 Pakistani soldiers to the retaliating Bengali Muslims and Indian Army ; making it the biggest surrender ever seen in Islamic history , although it was far from being an Islamic army The soldier of the Pakistani Army primarily fights for money and he justifies his moral corruption by taking pride in another un-Islamic concept of "" patriotic nationalism "" The salary of a Pakistani soldier is carefully determined It is slightly higher than the salary of other government employees but still much lower than the Western Crusader troops Resultantly , for higher salary , Pakistani soldiers would happily serve as paid mercenaries , anywhere in the world and under any conditions For their conscience , it does not matter if they are asked to fight against Muslim mujahidin , or they have to safeguard the Crusaders interest under the banner of United Nations ' "" peacekeepers "" at various places around the world The Pakistan Army's lust for money has been acknowledged many times in the past by their Crusader masters The Pakistan Army's lust for money and its justification through nationalism were clearly demonstrated during the tyrannical rule of Pervez Musharraf when he raised the slogan "" Pakistan comes first "" Following this satanic concept , the Pakistani Army martyred a considerable number of precious non-Pakistani mujahidin residing in Pakistan and many were sold to the Crusaders Before the launch of the Crusades in 2001 , soldiers of the Pakistani Army were traditionally prepared to fight against Hindus but their Crusader masters needed them to fight against sincere mujahidin The resulting confusion in the mind of the Pakistani soldiers was resolved by the Pakistani media and self proclaimed "" defence analysts "" who portrayed the mujahidin as Indian agents , thus providing Pakistani soldiers the justification to fight against them The Chief Crusaders , America and Britain , were painted as friends whose support is considered important to protect Pakistan from India and her "" agents "" It is quite baffling to see the effects of this spectacular brainwashing that Pakistani soldiers would see the Crusader enemies on their soil with their own eyes , using their roads , airports and seaports but they still do not comprehend the foreign troops as occupiers Instead , Pakistani soldiers are fighting and dying against mujahidin as if they were fighting against polytheist Hindus The Pakistani Army apparently takes great pride in calling itself a Muslim army but the majority of the personnel are detached from Islam Few people offer the prayers regularly and rarely does anyone practice the guidelines of the Qur'an and Sunnah As a result , immorality and corruption have seeped deep into the roots of the Pakistani Army and it is not uncommon to find alcoholics , gamblers , adulterers , homosexuals and drug traffickers amongst its lower and higher ranks Allah Almighty says in the Qur'an : ﴾ And there are some people who say : We believe in Allah and the last day ; and they are not at all believers They desire to deceive Allah and those who believe , and they deceive only themselves and they do not perceive There is a disease in their hearts , so Allah added to their disease and they shall have a painful chastisement because they lie And when it is said to them , do not make corruption in the land , they say , we are but the reformers ﴿ [ 2 : 8-11 ] If there is a voice to implement the shari ` ah within the Army or country , it is met with extreme brutality with the silent consent of the Western powers ; examples of which are the assassination of late President Zia ul Haq and the massacre of Islamabad's Red Mosque The thought process of Pakistan's Army commanders seems quite similar to the ideology given by a sixteenth century Italian military philosopher Niccolo Machiavelli Machiavelli was termed as devil incarnate by some of his contemporaries He writes in his book The Prince : In order to succeed , a conqueror should ignore moral considerations entirely and depend upon strength and cunning In taking a territory , the conqueror must arrange to commit all his cruelties at once , so as not to have to recur to them every day The Pakistani Army employs deception , lying and betrayal as the main strategies of war and one should never believe in any word coming from the mouth of a Pakistani Army personnel ""They've had a history of befriending mujahidin commanders but only to later sell their whereabouts to the Crusaders Here , it is worth mentioning the example of the gallant mujahid Commander Nek Muhammad who mistakenly trusted the Pakistani Army and made a treaty with Pakistani General Safdar in April 2004 Nek Muhammad was martyred about two months later by an American drone with the intelligence provided by the Pakistani Army ﴾ And when they meet those who believe , they say , "" We believe "" ; but when they are alone with their evil ones , they say , "" Indeed , we are with you ; we were only mockers . [ But ] Allah mocks them and prolongs them in their transgression [ while ] they wander blindly ﴿ [ 2 : 14-16 ] The Crusaders keep their influence over Pakistan's Army by controlling a few handpicked elite Generals who in turn exert their control over the whole army mainly through training curriculum and military laws The process of moral corruption starts at the very beginning of the training The training usually starts at a very young age and the recruits are brainwashed at various army schools , cadet colleges and military academies ; many of which have been running since British colonial era The mainstay of the training is to inculcate in every soldier the ideas of unquestioned obedience to the senior officers and absolute enslavement of the sub-ordinates in the name of "" leadership "" Hence , it is not surprising to see that a sepoy would be completely submitted to a non-commissioned officer ( NCO ); an NCO to a commissioned officer ; a commissioned officer to a General and ultimately the Generals would be in total submission to the Crusaders military and political hierarchy This phenomenon results in a well-organized system in the Army called the "" chain of command "" While their sway over internal military affairs within the ranks of Pakistan are not of the orchestrate nature , they are certainly acquainted with Pakistan's leadership Right from the induction into Pakistan's Army , recruits are made to idolize the Crusader armies as the height of professional excellence As an incentive , top cadets from the Pakistan Military Academy are sent to Royal Military Academy Sandhurst , UK for further training A major portion of military educational curriculum taught in the Pakistan Army institutions is based upon campaigns and tactics of the Allied Armies during the World Wars Officers who per form well in these institutions are promoted to higher ranks and further selected for foreign courses in the military institutions primarily in USA and UK where their loyalties to the Crusader armies are further ascertained Qualification from the Crusaders ' military institutions is one of the pre-requisites to become a General in the Pakistani Army As an example of this phenomenon , we can look at the career of present Chief of Army Staff General Ashfaq Parvez Kiani Kiani first studied at the Military College Jhelum ( MCJ ); a notorious institution inaugurated in 1922 by the British Prince of Wales that starts grooming the children as young as 12 with a dream of becoming a General in the Pakistani Army Kiani was then trained at the Pakistan Military Academy Kakul During his military career , he acquired higher education in the Pakistan at Command and Staff College Quetta and the National Defence University Islamabad Then he was further trained in various American military institutions that include the United States Army Infantry School , Fort Benning , Georgia ; the Command and General Staff College , Fort Leavenworth , Kansas and the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies , Honolulu , Hawaii , USA After grooming the suitable Pakistani Army officers , the Crusaders lift them to the position of Generals and then control them through the carrot and stick policy If Generals follow the agenda of their masters , they are showered with wealth and praises and if the Generals are not efficient in per forming their job , they are rebuked with the threats of assassination ""Allah's Messenger said : "" Nations will call each other , as people make invitations to a meal , to make a concerted attack on you . Someone asked : ' Will this happen because of our being small in number ""Allah's Messenger answered : "" Rather , you will then be great in number , but as powerless as woodchips or straw carried in a flood Allah will remove fear of you from the hearts of your enemies and implant in you love of this world and hatred of death . For the Pakistani Army , it is a lusting after this world and a fear of death In addition to education and training , the Western powers influence Pakistan's Army through military laws The civilian laws of the Pakistani state are already un-Islamic and have stemmed from the colonial laws of British rule , yet the Pakistani Army has its own independent laws that are , at occasions , outside the jurisdiction of civilian laws These military laws are compiled in the Manual of Pakistan Military Law ( MPML ) that consists of draconian orders set by the British to subdue the masses of the Indian population The influence of the Crusaders over the Pakistani Army is also evident from the fact that the ranks of the Pakistani and British Army are kept exactly the same , emphasizing their common origin However , in shoulder badges , the crown has been replaced by a star and crescent , perhaps to give an "" Islamic look "" to an otherwise slave army The services of the Pakistani Army to the Crusaders are so enormous and so significant that without them , the invasion and occupation of Afghanistan would have been impossible The Pakistani Army has provided secure airbases to Crusaders where their planes are stationed and fuelled Infamous drones are also based in the airports provided and secured by the Pakistani Army As a reward for these services , the Crusaders have paid a great amount of wealth to the Pakistani Army According to Pervez Musharraf , America had given $ 10 billion dollars in military aid by 2008 Under the Kerry Logar Bill , Pakistan's government and Army are to receive a further $ 7.5 billion dollars in next 5 years ""Pakistan's Army is providing very valuable services to the Crusaders at a very low cost It is estimated that the expenditure on a single American soldier in one year is around $ 1 million dollars while a Pakistani soldier is providing the same or maybe better services for just $ 3,000 dollars per year The supply line is one of the most important factors in fighting any war and the Pakistani Army has been instrumental in providing security to the Crusaders ' two main supply routes through Pakistan The Crusaders have generously provided vehicles , planes and equipment since 2001 that were previously unheard of in the Pakistani Army In the light of the above , it can be deduced that the Crusaders ' occupation of Afghanistan is standing on its historical asset , the Pakistani Army Until the Pakistani Army is standing and guarding the supply routes , the Crusaders are in the position to continue this war for a considerable length of time leading to further bloodshed of Afghani and Pakistani Muslims Hence , in order to bring down Crusaders ' military structure , it is important to strike a decisive blow to its pillar : the Pakistani Army Hence , the dealings with the Pakistani Army should be met with considerable terror and an effort should be made to publicize the retaliatory atrocities caused by them Their senior officers should be assassinated through targeted killings Once this Army is fear ful of mujahidin , it would not be able to protect the Crusaders ' supply lines , air bases , soldiers and private contractors in Pakistan who could then be targeted relatively easily leading to an ischaemia of the Crusader armies in Afghanistan After the Crusaders withdraw from Afghanistan , Pakistan's Army should be thoroughly annihilated and its personnel , who were complicit with the Crusaders , should be tried and executed publicly ﴾ Those who believe fight in the way of Allah , and those who disbelieve fight in the way of the Satan Fight therefore against the friends of Satan ; surely the strategy of the Satan is weak ﴿ [ 4 : 76 ] "
1,"Inspire magazine has announced that it would be holding a video session with myself to answer the questions we receive from our readers The most frequently asked question was about the legality of targeting non-combatants in countries that are at war with the Muslims This issue is surrounded with confusion and because of its importance and relevance to today's jihad , I would devote this article to answering it based on the evidence from Qur'an and Ĥadîth as well as the actual practices of the Messenger of Allah , his companions and the consecutive generations of the mujahidin We will also look into the realities of today's jihad and what methods of war are needed for its success ( fiqh al-w âqi ` ) This is the summary of the fiqh of the issue at hand : The scholars have divided the people of dâr al - ĥarb into combatants and non-combatants The scholars agree that all combatants may be targeted With the category of non-combatants it is more complex Scholars agree that women and children should not be intentionally targeted The scholars differed however on the ruling concerning the elderly , farmers , merchants and slaves But they all agree that if women , the elderly , farmers , merchants or slaves participate in the war effort against Muslims either by actual participation in fighting , financial contribution or opinion , they become legitimate targets If combatants and non-combatants are mixed together and integrated , it is allowed for the Muslims to attack them even if women , children , the elderly , farmers , merchants and slaves get killed but this should only be done with the intention of fighting the combatants If Muslims kill non-combatants in fighting there is no liability on the Muslims There is no retribution , no blood money to be paid and there is no sin on the Muslims in the eyes of Allah If Muslims get killed unintentionally or by mistake during the fight with the disbelievers , there is no sin on the Muslim who killed him but there is a kaff ârah which is fasting two months or feeding sixty poor persons There is a difference of opinion whether blood money should be paid Non-combatants should not be executed if they fall into captivity Islam does not allow the enemy to use our rules against us and to use our rules to our disadvantage The consideration of the continuation of jihad and the victory of the Muslims should always take precedence when the scholar gives a fatwa on a matter relating to jihad The following are aĥâdîth that prohibit the killing of non-combatants : Ibn Umar narrated that the Messenger of Allah prohibited the killing of women and children The Messenger of Allah said : "" Do not kill an old man or a child or a woman . The Messenger of Allah found a woman killed in one of his battles and said : "" She is not a fighter . Our scholars have used the terms muq âtilah and ghayr muq âtilah which translates into "" combatants "" and "" non-combatants "" respectively to classify the disbelievers who are at war with the Muslims It is the consensus of the scholars that Muslims should not kill the women and children of the disbelievers intentionally It is the word "" intentionally "" that should be explained here because it qualifies the above statement and a lack of understanding this rule is what leads to the confusion that surrounds this issue today What is meant is that women and children should not be singled out for killing ; women and children should not be killed if they fall into captivity and if they can be separated from the combatants in war they should But in no way does it mean that Islam prohibits the fighting against the disbelievers if their men , women and children are intermingled This understanding is very dangerous and detrimental to jihad and awareness on this issue is very important To stop the targeting of disbelievers who are at war with the Muslims just because there are women and children among them leads to constraints on today's jihad that make it very difficult , and at times , impossible to fight and places the Muslims at a great disadvantage compared to their enemy To properly understand this issue let's look at the statements of the scholars regarding attacking the enemy in their dwellings and laying siege to their towns During the time of the Messenger of Allah there was a form of fighting called bayat This is when the enemy would be attacked at night under the cover of darkness The attackers would ambush the enemy in their tents and houses and engage them in fighting This would lead to the deaths of men , women and children who were in the tents or homes because of the difficulty in distinguishing the difference between man , woman and child So is this form of fighting allowed in Islam The answer is yes The Messenger of Allah was asked about the ruling concerning the women and children who get targeted in bayat The Messenger of Allah said in an authentic narration : "" They belong to them . Which means that the ruling of the women and children is the same as that for the combatant men whom it is allowed to kill The Messenger of Allah permitted his companions to engage in this form of fighting even though , at occasions , entire families would be killed Salamah said : "" I myself have killed the inhabitants of nine houses . Imam Ahmad was asked about bayat He said : "" And is the fighting against the Romans but bayat ? In other words , Imam Ahmad not only approves of bayat but also states that it is the most common method of war employed by the Muslims against the Romans There is no difference in ruling between bayat and detonating a bomb in a populated center in a nation that is at war with the Muslims Just as the swords of the companions and those who followed them could not distinguish between man , woman and child and yet were allowed to engage in bayat , why should we ban bombings of populated areas in disbelieving countries The matter of bayat is agreed upon to the extent that Imam Ahmad said : "" We do not know of anyone who discouraged bayat . The other method of fighting which is relevant to our discussion is setting the catapult or mangonel against the cities of the disbelievers The scholars of sîrah mentioned that the Messenger of Allah set up the mangonel against al-Taif and that Amr bin al-Aas used it against Alexandria in Egypt The mangonel would strike its missiles against the city and did not distinguish between man , woman or child The ruling on using the mangonel against the enemy is summarized by Ibn Rushd who states that : "" It is the consensus of the jurists that it is allowed to set up catapults against the forts of the disbelievers whether there are women and children in them or not because of what was narrated to us that the Messenger of Allah set up the mangonel against the people of al-Taif . Imam al-Shafi'i says : "" It has been reported to us that the Messenger of Allah set up the mangonel against al-Taif So if it was necessary for the Muslims to not target the disbelievers because of the existence of children amongst them , the Messenger of Allah would have prohibited that because their cities and fortresses are not without women , children , elderly , ( Muslim ) prisoners , and merchants This narration from al-Taif ( that he used the mangonel ) and others is well preserved and well known from the sunnah of the Messenger of Allah and his sîrah It has also been the practice of the Muslims and the righteous predecessors from the companions of Muhammad to be as such in regards to the fortresses of the disbelievers before us and it has not been reported to us that any one of them stopped targeting a fortress by mangonel or other forms of weaponry just because of the existence of women , children or others who should not be killed among them . After mentioning that it is allowed to use the mangonel , Imam al-Mawardi says that : "" The prohibition of the Messenger of Allah of killing women and children applies to when they fall captive since they are booty for the Muslims But when the women and children are in the land of war they can be targeted as their men because the land of war is a land that is permissible ( to target its people ) . But even with the mangonel , the scholars allowed its use against civilian targets based on the need Imam al-Shafi'i states that if the Muslims are at a distance from the fort or the town they should fire only at the walls and not at the homes of the disbelievers However , if they are close to the walls then they are allowed to fire at the homes Again , with the mangonel just as with bayat , it leads to the loss of lives of non-combatants A mangonel missile that strikes at a city and which is by no means an accurate weapon is no different than bombing a city of a nation that is at war with the Muslims Therefore from the above two pieces of evidence it becomes clear that Muslims are allowed to target the populations of countries that are at war with the Muslims by bombings or firearm attacks or other forms of attacks that inevitably lead to the deaths of non-combatants Notice that I haven't even brought up the evidence of treating the enemy as they treat us With all the aggression the West is committing against the Muslims this additional evidence leaves no room for those who argue on behalf of the general populations of the West It is important to look into the foundations , which our classical scholars based their fat âwâ on concerning jihad to see why they came to different conclusions compared to many scholars of today Imam Abu Zakaria al-Ansari : "" It is allowed to set up the mangonel on a fort even if it would strike ( the non-combatants ) so that they do not use that as a way to disable jihad or as a ruse to keep their fortresses and in that is great evil . Imam al-Nawawi : "" If there is in the town or the fortress a Muslim , a ( Muslim ) prisoner , a merchant , a disbeliever who is given peace , or a group of the aforementioned , is it allowed to target the population with fire or mangonels and what is similar to that There are different ways in the madhab ( school of thought ) First , if it is not necessary to strike them then the stronger opinion is that it is not recommended to do so but it is not prohibited This is so that jihad does not become disabled because of a Muslim who is among the disbelievers If it is necessary to strike them due to fear from harm that would befall the Muslims from them or because the fortress could not be opened in any other way , then there is no doubt that it is allowed to strike them The second way in the madhab is that there is no consideration for necessity If striking them would lead to the death of a Muslim they should not strike them otherwise there are two opinions The third way , and this is mentioned by the author of al-Sh âmil , is that if the number of Muslims among them is equal to the disbelievers we should not strike them but if they are less , then we can strike them because most of the harm would not be on the Muslims The official position of the madhab , and this is what is stated in al-Mukhtasar , is that it is allowed to strike them even if it is known that it would inflict harm on the Muslims ( among the disbelievers ) because the sanctity of the Muslims on our side is greater than the sanctity of the Muslims who are among them If some Muslims do get killed they are martyrs . Imam Ibn Qudamah al-Maqdisi : "" If they ( the enemy ) shield themselves in war by women and children and others who should not be killed , it is allowed to target them with the intention of killing the combatants This is because the Prophet used the mangonel even though there were women and children among them It is also because if the Muslims seize attacking them this would lead to the disablement of jihad since the enemy would use this shield to protect themselves whenever they feel threatened by the Muslims It is allowed to strike against them whether the battle is raging or not because the Prophet did not wait to strike only at the times when the battle was underway . Imam Ibn Qudamah al-Maqdisi also says : "" It was reported by Ali bin Abi Talib that the Prophet set up the mangonel against the people of al-Taif ; and flooding the enemy with water is similar to that If there are Muslims among them and we can conquer the enemy without using such methods , then we shouldn't because it would lead to the shedding of blood without any necessity but if we cannot conquer them unless we use such methods then it is allowed because prohibiting that would lead to the disablement of jihad . This is just a sample of quotations from our classical scholars to show that the continuation of jihad takes precedence over other considerations and that whatever would lead to the disablement of jihad should be abrogated Many of the modern scholars have placed a set of rigid rules that if followed would make jihad impossible or at least put the Muslims in a position of disadvantage compared to an enemy who has no morals when it comes to its war against Islam Some of the restrictions placed on jihad by some of the modern scholars include : Jihad should not be fought without the permission of the king or president ; Martyrdom operations are not allowed ; Any operation that leads to the death of disbelieving women and children is not allowed The first restriction by itself would lead to the complete abandonment of jihad because none of the kings or presidents ( who are apostates to start with ) would allow jihad for the sake of Allah The only type of war they would allow is a war that benefits them personally and protects their power They would care less about a war that is for the sake of Allah , the promotion of Islam or the defense of Muslims The other two restrictions rule out most of the operation methods available for the mujahidin today Imam Ibn Rushd says that it is the consensus of the jurists that fortresses could be struck with mangonels whether there are women and children in them or not Imam al-Shafi'i says : "" It has also been the practice of the Muslims and the righteous predecessors from the companions of Muhammad to be as such in regards to the fortresses of the disbelievers before us and it has not been reported to us that any one of them stopped targeting a fortress by mangonel or other forms of weaponry just because of the existence of women or children or others who should not be killed among them . And Imam Ahmad said : "" And is the fighting against the Romans but bayat ? It has been the practice of the Messenger of Allah in his battles to attack populations of the disbelievers even if women and children get unintentionally killed ; it has been the practice of the four righteous Caliphs , the Umayyads , the Abbasids , the Ayyubids , the Muslims in Spain and the Mamluks in their wars to ambush the Romans in bayat and to use mangonels against them ; and it has been the practice of the Ottomans to use artillery in their sieges against the disbelievers ' towns and cities So can we throw away 1,400 years of war methods out of the window and come up today with new unfair rules for our jihad What the Muslims didn't do is kill them intentionally or kill them when they surrendered and fell into captivity A sound understanding of this issue is very much needed today in order not to restrict our jihad or put our brothers at jeopardy by banning them from feasible targets just because it would lead to the deaths of non-combatants , and only allow them to attack military targets that are more protected Modes of operation that would be allowed according to the above evidence : The use of explosives against populated areas in nations that are at war with Muslims is allowed Explosive devices are similar to the effect a mangonel would have Mangonel missiles were either stones which would fall and kill by impact or by shrapnel caused by them or containers that are filled with an incendiary material which would kill by burning Some scholars have equated explosives to the use of fire against the enemy , which isn't exactly accurate It is true that explosives do produce high temperatures but most deaths are caused by shrapnel and by the detonation wave The heat of the explosion causes the least number of casualties This is the case with most explosive materials But whether the death is caused by heat or by shrapnel , explosives are similar in legislation to the use of the mangonel The use of firearms in operations such as that of Mumbai , which is targeted at the general population , is allowed and is similar to the bayat method of war discussed above The shooter can fire randomly at crowds but should avoid the execution of women or children when the target is clear The use of poisons or chemical and biological weapons against population centers is allowed and is strongly recommended due to its great effect on the enemy Regarding the importance and permissibility of using such weapons , the classical scholars have said the following : Imam al-Mawardi : "" The Messenger of Allah set up the catapult on al-Taif when he laid siege to it following the opening of Makkah It is allowed to attack the enemy ( in the place where they live such as their cities or villages ) when they are not aware , like what the Messenger of Allah did with Bani al-Mustalaq , and it is allowed to attack them at night and set fire to their homes and throw on them fire , snakes or scorpions , demolish their homes with them inside , release floods onto them , cutoff their water supply , and do onto them all what would lead to their destruction without refraining just because of the women and children that are among them , even if that would lead to the deaths of their women and children This is because the Messenger of Allah did not stop from attacking Bani al-Mustalaq or al-Taif because of their women and children The instruction of the Messenger of Allah not to kill women and children is when they are intentionally executed ; also when they fall as booty they should not be killed However when they are residing in dâr al - ĥarb , it is ĥalâl to target them and they carry the same ruling as their men . Imam al-Sarkhasi ( a Hanafi scholar ) quotes Muhammad ibn al-Hassan from Shar ĥ al-Sayr al-Kab îr : "" It is allowed for the Muslims to burn the fortresses of the disbelievers with fire , to flood them with water , or to put blood , feces or poison in their water until they contaminate it because Allah commanded us to subdue them and break their strength and all the methods of war which we mentioned that would lead to their weakening would be fulfilling the commands ( of Allah ) and would not fall under disobeying ( of Allah ) All of this also damages the enemy and that is a way to obtain rewards Allah says : ﴾ Nor do they inflict any injury upon an enemy but is written to their credit as a deed of righteousness ﴿ [ 9 : 120 ] None of the mentioned ( methods of war ) are prohibited if there is among them Muslim prisoners of war , people who are given peace , young or old , men or women even if we know that , because there is no way to avoid them and at the same time fulfill the commands of subjugating the disbelievers and whatever is not possible to avoid is forgiven . Imam Ibn Farhoon ( a Maliki scholar ): "" The enemy is fought in every way , and with fire if there is no other means if we fear harm from them If we do not fear harm from them then there are two opinions [ … ] It is not disputable that we are allowed to strike their ships and fortresses with the mangonel even if Muslims are therein . Imam al-Kharshi ( a Maliki scholar ): "" It is allowed to fight the enemy if they do not respond to what we call them to with all forms of war It is allowed to cut off water from them to kill them from thirst , to release floods on them , to drown them according to the famous opinion , or to kill them with weapons such as a blow from a sword , a stab from a lance , a missile from a mangonel or other weapons of war . Imam al-Shafi'i : "" If the enemy protects himself in a mountain , a fortress , a trench , with thorn trees , or with any form of protection it is allowed to strike them with mangonels , catapults , fire , scorpions , snakes and all what harms them It is allowed to flood them with water to drown them , or to get them hampered in mud That is whether women , children and priests are among them or not because the land ( of war ) is not protected with Islam or with a covenant It is also acceptable to burn their fruit trees or other trees , to destroy their buildings and all what doesn't have a soul from their belongings . Imam al-Bahuti ( a Hanbali scholar ): "" It is also allowed to strike them ( the disbelievers ) and put fire , snakes , or scorpions in the scales of the mangonel , to fill their tunnels with smoke , to release floods on them in order to drown them , and to destroy their fortresses and buildings But if we can defeat them without the use of fire then we shouldn't use it . Imam al-Shawkani : "" Allah has commanded us to kill the disbelievers without specifying the methods of doing so Allah did not command us to do this or not do that Therefore there is no preventing from killing them with every means of killing whether it is shooting , stabbing , flooding , demolishing buildings on them or throwing them from heights . These statements of the scholars show that it is allowed to use poison or other methods of mass killing against the disbelievers who are at war with us In addition to that , there are many other important insights in their statements that the reader may benefit from The populations of the nations that are at war with the Muslims and especially those who are at the lead such as the U . S . , Britain and France should be targeted by the mujahidin in operations that employ explosives , poisons , firearms and all other methods that lead to inflicting the greatest harm on them and this is among the greatest deeds a Muslim can worship Allah with in our day and time "
1,"The Islamic ummah is vast and so are the arenas in which targets and interests of the invader enemy are present It is furthermore impossible for all the youth who want to participate in the Resistance to travel to the arenas of [ open ] confrontation It is even unlikely that such Fronts should emerge in the foreseeable future Hence , our method should therefore be to guide the Muslim who wants to participate and resist , to operate where he is , or where he is able to be present in a natural way We should advise him to pursue his everyday life in a natural way , and to pursue jihad and Resistance in secrecy and alone , or with a small cell of trustworthy people , who form an independent unit for Resistance and for the individual jihad Regarding the priority of arenas in which we must strike the enemy , the list of priority arenas is as follows : Wherever you hurt the enemy the most and inflict upon him the heaviest losses Wherever you arouse Muslims the most and awaken the spirit of jihad and Resistance in them Thus , the list of arenas , arranged according to their importance , is as follows : The countries on the Arabian Peninsula , the Levant , Egypt and Iraq : This area contains the holy places , the oil , Israel , the countries encircling her , and the American military and economic presence , and it is the fundamental and final site for the victorious group ( al - ţâ ' ifah al-man Şûrah ) for all time to come The countries of North Africa from Libya to Mauritania : There are Western interests in this region , especially those of the main European countries allied with America in the NATO Turkey , Pakistan , and the countries HISTORY & STRATEGY of Central Asia : They contain the second largest oil reserves in the world , and America's strategic interests , military bases , and main economic investments They have large and historical Islamic movements , which are regarded as being a strategic depth for the Arab jihadi and Resistance movements The rest of the Islamic world : The Americans and their allies have interests and a presence in this region The Islamic world as a whole contains the main backbone of the Resistance , which is the Islamic Nation's youth sympathizing with its causes and wishing to participate in the jihad and the Resistance It is a backbone consisting of hundreds of millions of Muslims The American and allied interests in the third world countries : Especially in those countries participating in the Crusader campaign This is due to their weak security capabilities , compared with the security regulations that the Western countries implement in their own countries Jihad in these countries rests fundamentally on the shoulders of the mujahidun who basically reside in those countries , and live a normal life there This helps them in moving , hiding , gaining knowledge of the targets and dealing with them in an easy manner In European countries allied with America and participating with her in the war : This is due to the presence of old and large Islamic communities in Europe Their number exceeds 45 million , and there are communities of millions in Australia , Canada and South America as well Especially in Europe , because of its closeness to the Arab and Islamic world , and the inter - twining of interests between them , and because of all the movement and transportation between the two The Muslims in those countries are like Muslims everywhere ; the religious duty of jihad , of repelling the enemy and resisting him , rests on their shoulders in exactly the same way as for Muslims in their own countries [ i . e . , Muslims residing in the Arab and Islamic world ] Action in Europe and those countries must be subjected to the rules of political benefits versus political harms , judged against the positions of the European governments At the same time , one has to adopt a strategy of winning the support of the people , and avoid harming them I will present this in detail in the political theory of the Resistance , Allah willing In the heart of America herself , by targeting her with effective strategic operations , as will be explained in the following paragraphs , Allah willing : She [ America ] is the snake's head , as Shaykh Usama rightfully named her And she is the origin of scourge and the head of the alliance When defeated , this alliance will break up , and we will move to a new historical era , Allah willing "
1,"All praise is due to All āh , who created the Creation to worship Him alone , and ordered them to follow good and avoid evil , and forbade them from corruption on land and in the sea As to what follows : This is a message to the whole world about those who cause climate change and its dangers – intentionally or unintentionally – and what we must do Talk of climate change isn't extravagant speculation : it is a tangible fact which is not diminished by its being muddled by some greedy heads of major corporations The effect of global warming have spread to all continents of the world Drought , desertication and sands are advancing on one front , while on another front , torrential oods and huge storms the likes of which only used to be seen once every few decades now reoccur every few years ""That's in addition to the islands which are quietly and calmly sinking under the waters of the oceans ; and the pattern is accelerating and reports by organizations dealing with the affairs of displaced people estimate the displacement of as many as a billion humans during the next four decades as a result of this I am not about to talk here about partial solutions which merely lessen the harmful effects of global warming Rather , I am going to talk about looking for a solution to the crisis at its roots In front of the world are the records which show the huge numbers of victims of climate change , some of whom died of hunger and others of whom died of drowning In the same year in which [ James E . ] Hansen , NASA's senior expert , confirmed the seriousness of global warming , 140,000 died and 24 million were displaced in oods in Bangladesh alone ; and the caravan of victims of climate change hasn't stopped since , so those behind it must be identified and a way of dealing with them specified All industrialized countries , especially the major ones , bear responsibility for the global warming crisis , except that most of them have called on each other to commit to the Kyoto Protocol and have agreed to reduce emissions of harmful gases However , Bush Junior – and prior to him , Congress – rejected this agreement in order to please the major corporations They , therefore , are the real culprits behind the assault on the global climate , and this isn't the first of their crimes against humanity : they themselves were also behind the current global financial crisis , and they themselves were behind all the speculation , monopolization and price rises in peoples ' sustenance They are also behind globalization and its tragic consequences represented by its adding tens of millions of people to the ranks of the impoverished and unemployed And then , when the culprits themselves fall victim to their own evil deeds , the presidents of countries rush to their rescue with public funds ; and in this way , the people's wealth is seized without right twice : one time through corporate fraud and monopolization , and another time through governmental deception and power Many senior capitalists are characterized by wickedness and hardheartedness , and thus they don't care about the human disasters caused by their economic activities Words , conferences and demonstrations are of no use with such people Hansen spoke out and warned Americans about the seriousness of global warming in 1988 , but they didn't respond to him As for conferences , the Kyoto conference took place at the end of the last century , but they didn't respond to it And as for demonstrations , not even the largest of them – much less the smaller ones – were able to deter them from their greed and tyranny Prior to the invasion of Iraq in 2003 , people throughout the world's continents took out million-strong demonstrations in which they echoed one phrase : "" No to the spilling of red blood because of black oil . But the result was that the mob boss mocked them and gave orders to start the savage assault on innocent people in Iraq whose only sin in his eyes was the presence of black gold in their country So they killed , wounded , orphaned , widowed and displaced more than 10 million Iraqis , and they are still murdering and pillaging ""That's not to mention the crimes at Abū Ghraib and Guantanamo , those ugly crimes which shook the conscience of humanity And after these lean years , there has been no mentionable change in the things which matter ; and after all of this , their new proxy was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and he accepted it in an extreme example of the deception and humiliation of humanity With this , the bitter truth becomes clear , which is that the world has been kidnapped by the heads of major corporations who are steering it towards the abyss The policies of the world today are not being steered with the power of superior intellects to serve the interest of the people ; but rather , with the power of the motivation and greed of oil-robbers and warmongers , the beasts of predatory capitalism Noam Chomsky was right when he pointed to a similarity between American policies and the policies of gangs So they are the real terrorists , and drastic and decisive solutions are required to restrain and subdue them : restrain them from their sin and subdue their savagery ; and I place in front of you a number of solutions These are : First : the corruption of the climate stems from the corruption of hearts and deeds , and there is a close relationship between the two types of corruption We know that All āh has punished peoples with tsunamis due to the corruption of their hearts and deeds and their disobedience to All āh , the Most High ; among them were Pharaoh and his people All āh says , ( Corruption has spread on land and in the sea because of what men's hands have wrought , that He may make them taste the fruit of some of their doings , so that they may turn back from evil ) [ Ar-R ū m : 41 ] Thus the happy one is he who learns his lesson , asks for forgiveness and dedicates all worship to All āh alone , who has no partner , through His final message to all of mankind Second : that we be economical in all of our affairs and avoid luxury and wastefulness , especially in food , drink , clothing , housing and energy Third : factories ' emissions stop when the factories stop , and the way to achieve their stoppage is easy , simple and in your hands The wheel of the American economy is like a bicycle wheel : if it loses one link in its chain , it stops moving ; and among the links of the wheel of the American economy are raw materials , capital and consumers We can a reject all these links to varying degrees , but the last one is the weakest and our ability to influence it the greatest So if the peoples of the world were to stop consuming American goods , this last link would become even weaker , leading in turn to a decrease in harmful gases Fourth : there must be accounting and punishment for those who head the major corporations and their political proxies , so that they stop their harmful actions against humanity This is an easy thing for the American people , especially those affected by Hurricane Katrina and those without jobs as a result of the economic crisis , because the culprits live in their midst , particularly in Washington , New York and Texas And here is their position at the Denmark conference demonstrating their evasiveness and how they are not serious about making the moves required to deal with climate change , as has also been shown by their denial of responsibility for previous catastrophes and their refusal to compensate the victims On the contrary , they continue to insist on meddling with world climate for the sake of acquiring wealth , even if that be at the cost of our children's lives Fifth : we should refuse to do business with the dollar and get rid of it as soon as possible I know that this action has huge consequences and massive repercussions ; but it is an important way to liberate humanity from enslavement and servitude to America and its corporations And whatever might be said about the repercussions of this decision , the fact is that remaining enslaved to them has great and more serious repercussions An opportunity should be first given to individuals to get rid of the dollar and related currencies , inasmuch as states with large reserves of dollars – particularly in East Asia – are able to bear many of those repercussions It isn't a secret that the dollar has lost more than 80 % of its value against the euro since the latter's introduction , and the same is true for currencies tied to the dollar Additionally , gold has risen more than 400 % against the dollar since the events of September 11th , and the dollar is continuing to slide , by the grace of All āh , and I reckon that its losses against the euro will be a whole lot more than 100 % ; and it's no secret to those familiar with military , political , economic and social sciences that America's star is waning , its economy is shriveling and the dollar's ship is sinking And the happy one is he who learns from other's mistakes In closing , the world has before it a rare and historic opportunity to liberate itself from servitude to America , as the latter ends itself in a serious predicament – by the grace of All āh – drowning in the marshes of Iraq and lost in the passes of Afghanistan The heroic muj āhidīn are inflicting on them severe moral and material losses , and they want to escape but cannot , and they are looking with sorrowful and dejected eyes at their rivals in the East and West whose situation has improved and wealth has increased following America's hemorrhaging and its preoccupation with combating the muj āhidīn ; and for All āh is all praise So to all people , all inhabitants of earth : it is neither just nor equitable nor wise nor smart that the burden be left on the muj āhidīn alone in an issue whose adverse effects concern the entire world What is being asked of you is simple : it is that you tighten the embargo against them So be earnest and take the initiative in boycotting them , in order to save yourselves , your wealth and your children from climate change and in order to live freely and honorably [ instead of standing on ] the steps of conferences and begging for your lives , for there is no good in a life which incurs humiliation And wealthy states must stop lending to America , because to lend to it is to its tyrannical wars against the weak , particularly the one against your neighbors in Afghanistan As for the muj āhidūn , they will – All āh willing – persist in their fighting of the oppressors in Iraq and Afghanistan , in order to achieve truth , cancel falsehood and help the Muslims , especially in Palestine , and in order to defend weak and disaster-stricken people in Asia , Africa and South America who have neither strength nor power And our final prayer is that all praise is due to All āh , Lord of the worlds "
1,"The Almighty Allah preordained upon his believing slaves the worship of jihad , and informed them that it is hateful to them as He said : ﴾ Fighting has been enjoined upon you while it is hateful to you ﴿ [ 2 : 216 ] Thus , hardship , illness , striving against the soul's desires , hunger , thirst , fear , suffering , separation from family and dwelling ; all of these features that are attached to this ibâdah are in actuality part of it : ﴾ And We will surely test you with something of fear and hunger and a loss of wealth and lives and fruits , but give good tidings to the patient ﴿ [ 2 : 155 ] The Almighty said : ﴾ It was not [ proper ] for the people of Madinah and those surrounding them of the Bedouins that they remain behind after [ the departure of ] the Messenger of Allah or that they prefer themselves over his self That is because they are not afflicted by thirst or fatigue or hunger in the cause of Allah , nor do they tread on any ground that enrages the disbelievers , nor do they inflict upon an enemy any infliction but that it is registered for them as a righteous deed Indeed , Allah does not allow to be lost the reward of the doers of good ﴿ [ 9 : 120 ] Due to these features and others , jihad became hateful to the souls that are use to inclining towards seeking safety , dependence on gentleness , contentment with comfort and far-removed from dangers Hence , the requirements of jihad and the necessities of the soul are in most cases inconsistent as the Almighty said : ﴾ O you who have believed , what is [ the matter ] with you that , when you are told to go forth in the cause of Allah , you adhere heavily to the earth Are you satisfied with the life of this world rather than the Hereafter But what is the enjoyment of worldly life compared to the Hereafter except a [ very ] little ﴿ [ 9 : 38 ] He , Glory be to Him , said : ﴾ Say , [ O Muhammad ] , "" If your fathers , your sons , your brothers , your wives , your relatives , wealth which you have obtained , commerce wherein you fear decline , and dwellings with which you are pleased are more beloved to you than Allah and His Messenger and jihad in His cause , then wait until Allah executes His command And Allah does not guide the defiantly disobedient people ﴿ [ 9 : 24 ] And He said : ﴾ Have you not seen those who were told , "" Restrain your hands [ from fighting ] and establish prayer and give zakah "" But then when fighting was ordained for them , at once a party of them feared men as they fear Allah or with [ even ] greater fear They said , "" Our Lord , why have You decreed upon us fighting If only You had postponed [ it for ] us for a short time . Say , "" The enjoyment of this world is little , and the Hereafter is better for he who fears Allah And injustice will not be done to you , [ even ] as much as a thread [ inside a date seed ] ﴿ [ 4 : 77 ] Therefore , jihad demands dedication , rising to lift its loads , bearing its difficulty , and patience in performing it However , the soul declines that and it lowers itself to the lowest level on earth , clinging to its adornments It is busy with the enjoyment of this worldly life and is also satisfied with it Hence , in fighting there is death and horror in front of the soul , and in this present life , behind the soul there is the offspring and fortune So it is either that the soul backslides to duny â or sets off to jihad , in spite of the goodness that the soul is undertaking by following this step However , the soul is fond of hastiness so it desires everything in cash and does not accept anything on credit It is either jihad or disgrace , so choose From this saying we learn the secret of our Prophet's words : "" When you enter into a transaction , hold the tails of oxen , are pleased with agriculture , and give up conducting jihad , Allah will make disgrace prevail over you , and will not withdraw it until you return to your [ original ] religion . It can be understood from this hadith that jihad should always be given priority , and that it is not for anybody to transcend in leaving it through being busy with a matter from this present-life's dealings However , if performing the ` ibâdah of jihad is possible along with being engaged in farming , cultivation or business , then that is different Otherwise , the ` ibâdah of jihad in which life remains , religion is saved and achievements are protected is given precedence Imam Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali , may Allah have mercy upon him , said : "" And that is why the companions , may Allah be pleased with them , disliked engaging in the taxation of farming land because it distracts from jihad . The shah îd , Imam Ibn an-Nuhas , may Allah have mercy upon him , said about the aforementioned hadith : "" And the meaning of the hadith is that if people abandon jihad and engage in farming or such then the enemy will consequently hold sway over them because of their lack of readiness and preparation to confront overwhelming times It is also because of their acceptance to the conditions which they are in ( i . e . , luxuries , accommodations , conveniences ) So Allah made disgrace and humiliation prevail over them to the extent that they cannot liberate themselves from that until they return to what is obligatory upon them of fighting the disbelievers , being harsh upon them , establishing the religion , supporting Islam and its people , making Allah's word the highest and demeaning disbelief and its people And his sayings "" until you return to your [ original ] religion ' ' indicates that abstaining and turning away from jihad as well as relying and having confidence in the duny â is in fact leaving off the religion and detaching from it and that's enough as a sin and a clear wrongdoing . It is not meant by leaving the religion – and Allah knows best – the type of kufr which takes one outside the fold of the religion as some might understand I don't think that anybody from amongst the people of knowledge would say concerning the Muslim who intently leaves jihad and relies on duny â that by doing so becomes a disbeliever But – and Allah knows best – the comprehensive meaning is to declare that abandonment of the ` ibâdah of jihad and occupying oneself with the affairs of the duny â which diverts one from it will consequently lead to the dominance of the disbelieving enemy which imposes its mastery over the land of the Muslims It also leads to the implementation of their blasphemous man-made rulings upon them along with their fighting against the religion and its law out of envy , hatred and enmity towards the truth and its people All of that will result in the publicity of corruption , the spreading of kufr and the weakening of the religion as well as its decline in the people's hearts ; and with the succession of generations that recognize neither a truth nor a religion , a new generation arises on error and kufr We seek refuge in Allah , and the best example for that is what took place in Andalusia , which has become forgotten today This all means that repelling the disbelievers and protecting the lands and the religion of the Muslims is not done except by jihad in Allah's way Also the hadith shows that the effort of the du ` ât should be aimed at returning to the ` ibâdah of jihad and inciting people to fulfill it That is because jihad is the legitimate gateway for matters to be righted and brought back to their original condition so that the religion is honored , kufr is dishonored , Islam is spread and shirk is restrained Some of Imam AbSome of Imam Abu Abdullah al - Halimi's statements will be mentioned which emphasizes on this meaning For this reason , some scholars considered jihad as a pillar from the religion's pillars and it is deserving to be so as Imam Ibn Qasim al-Hanbali , may Allah have mercy upon him , said in his compilation ' Ala al-Rawd : "" And some regarded it ( jihad ) as a sixth pillar for the religion of Islam That is why they quoted it after the five pillars of Islam . "
1,"""THERE'S BEEN a lot of talk about bad "" optics "" the past couple days about Obama's tango twirls while Europe had suffered a murderous jihad attack in Brussels and perps are still at large But to my eye , the pope performing an Easter footwashing ritual meant to show humility in the Catholic style must look more like surrender to the headchopper thugs of ISIS This being the migrant-loving Pope Francis , he made a show of embracing foreigner diversity by including Muslim , Christian and Hindu asylum-seekers , instead of ministering to 12 Catholic men as previous popes have done Humbling himself to Muslim invaders can easily be seen by jihadists as a big step forward in their plan to defeat the Christians in the Catholics ' capital city ( See my blog from last fall : A Goal of ISIS Is to Conquer Rome in Five Years ) Showing weakness to the bloodthirsty enemies of civilization and freedom is unwise to say the least In a special rite commemorating the Last Supper of Jesus with his disciples , Pope Francis washed and kissed the feet of 11 Muslim , Christian and Hindu asylum-seekers Thursday and declared them all children of the same Father The Holy Thursday ritual re-enacts Jesus washing his apostles ' feet before being crucified , and is meant as a gesture of service Francis contrasted that gesture with the "" gesture of war "" carried out by the Brussels attackers on Monday Instead of celebrating Mass in the Vatican as usual , the Pope traveled to the welcome center in the town of Castelnuovo di Porto , where he greeted the asylum-seekers , many of whom are not Christians The Pope told them that Jesus ' gesture of service stood in sharp contrast to Judas ' gesture of betrayal , which the Pope likened to the brutal jihadist attacks In denouncing the attacks , the Pope said its perpetrators wanted to destroy the brotherhood of humanity Pope Francis knelt and washed the feet of four Catholics from Nigeria , three Eritrean women who are Coptic Christians , three Muslims from Mali , Syria and Pakistan , a Hindu man from India and an Italian woman who works at the center Several migrants wept as Francis knelt before them , poured water from a brass pitcher over their feet , wiped them clean and kissed them "" We have different cultures and religions , but we are brothers and we want to live in peace , "" Francis said in his homily , delivered in the courtyard of the welcome center "" All of us , together : Muslims , Hindi , Catholics , Copts , Evangelicals But brothers , children of the same God , "" he said "" We want to live in peace , integrated . In his Palm Sunday homily earlier this week , the Pope spoke of Jesus ' radical humility , living among us in "" the condition of a servant "" rather than that of a king or a prince , and the abyss of his humiliation "" seems to be bottomless . He bent down to wash the feet of his disciples , laying aside his role as "" Lord and Master "" and preferring the position of a servant , Francis noted The Pope also compared Jesus to today's migrants , saying that Jesus had been shuffled around as nobody's problem "" Pilate then sends him to Herod , who in turn sends him to the Roman governor , "" Francis said , and "" no one wishes to take responsibility for his fate . "" And I think of the many people , so many outcasts , so many asylum seekers , so many refugees , all of those for whose fate no one wishes to take responsibility , "" he said During 2015 , Europe processed some 1.3 million asylum claims , of which 292,540 were approved as refugees The majority came from Syria , Afghanistan and Iraq "
1,"THERE WAS A TIME when Whites were not the simpering , whimpering things they have become Here is a powerful speech by South African legislator and diplomat Eric Louw ( pictured ) introducing a bill into the South African House of Deputies in early 1939 calling for the prohibition of all future Jewish immigration into that country It was not an act to end all immigration or to restrict it by circumlocutory quotas favoring one region over another ( while carefully failing to mention Jews ) , as in the 1924 legislation in the US No This bill came slashingly to the point It said crisply and clearly "" No more Jews . In 1939 Hitler was shining a light over Europe , whence Jews were decamping by the tens of thousands Waves of loot-laden Semites were already beginning to lap into the harbors of Cape Town and Durban Concurrently , Jewish monopolistic pressures in South Africa were giving Whites and Blacks alike the financial bends While the liquor , diamond , and department store kings were rolling in their opulence , the Afrikaner farmer was getting poorer But economics was only one reason for the bill Let us hear from Eric Louw himself as his words appeared in Debates of the House of Assembly ( Hansard ) , 2nd Session , 8th Parliament , Volume 33 ( Feb . 3 – Mar 31 , 1939 ): Since this Bill was published it has been very severely criticised in the Press It has been described as contemptible , as intolerant , as uncouth , and what not I myself have been labelled as a racialist , as un-Christian , as a political opportunist , and as a South African prototype of Herr Streicher Coming from certain sections of the Press , I do not think that the criticisms need be taken too seriously either as reflecting the considered opinion of these particular newspapers , or as reflecting the opinion of the majority of their readers … What we have heard has been nothing but "" His Master's Voice , "" that voice which does not hesitate to command or to threaten when Jewish interests are involved … We have been witnessing the same sort of thing in international affairs during the past few years , and particularly during the month of September of last year in regard to the news reports which have been coming to South Africa from most of Europe Those news reports I am convinced were then , and to-day still are , to a large extent inspired by Jewish influence Those reports were , and are intended to stir up public feeling in regard to Germany The efforts of Mr . Chamberlain and of M . Daladier towards appeasement have been rendered infinitely more difficult by the overt and hidden campaign which has been carried on under the influence of Jewish pressure , by the news agencies and by the Press In September of last year a very considerable section of world Jewry was literally praying for England to be involved in a war with Germany They were bitterly disappointed when Mr . Chamberlain and M . Daladier were able to come to an agreement with Herr Hitler at Munich and they have not yet forgiven Mr . Chamberlain and M . Daladier I am convinced that if it were possible to remove Jewish influence and Jewish pressure from the Press , and from the news agencies , the international outlook would be considerably brighter than it is to-day In introducing this Bill I am actuated neither by Fascism nor racialism I have acted solely as a South African , as a member , sir , of one of the two sections of our population in South Africa whose forefathers were the pioneers of this country , who built up South Africa and made it what it is to-day I am a member of one of those two sections that are going to remain in South Africa There is amongst either the English or the Dutch-speaking South Africans nothing which is comparable to the Zionist movement of the Jews In introducing this Bill I have acted as a South African who is genuinely worried about the creation of a new and additional race problem in South Africa In the second place I , and those who feel with me , are worried about the extent to which a race , alien to , and unassimilable with the English and Dutch-speaking population in South Africa , has during past years been securing control of business and industry , and also of the professions I know that in this matter my feelings are shared by tens of thousands of South Africans , English as well as Afrikaans-speaking … The main principle of this Bill is that it admits the existence in South Africa of a Jewish problem , and it faces up to that problem … I say that if it is not faced , and if it is not tackled , we are going to have in South Africa a repetition of the history that has taken place in the countries of Europe … Now , Mr . Speaker , it is perhaps appropriate that this matter of Communism should be dealt with in a Bill which also deals with the Jewish question , because Communism , since its earliest days has been linked with Jewry This has been denied by the Jews but such denial is not in accordance with the facts I do not suggest that all Jews are Communists But I do say that the Jews were the people who conceived the idea of Communism , and it was by the Jews that Communism was directed , and is still being directed to-day That is perfectly comprehensible because Communism is international , and a Jew is international in his outlook Communism had its birth in the teachings of Karl Marx , who was a Jew If we study the history of the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia , we find that the great majority of those who were the instigators of the revolution , and who occupied the most prominent posts in the Bolshevic Government were Jews ..I can also speak from my personal observations during the course of my diplomatic service in the Union , when I had the opportunity of seeing who were the representatives of this Soviet Government I found that in most cases they were of the Jewish race I remember the Soviet delegation to the league of Nations In that delegation there were seven Jews and one Russian We find that in most countries where Communism has taken root the leaders of Communism are Jews That is also the case in South Africa The two leaders of Communism in South Africa are Mssrs Solly Sachs and Weinberg … [ It is ] clearly established that it was the intention of the Communist Party to establish in South Africa a Black republic … Now I come to what is the main feature of the Bill , namely the new principle introduced of definitely naming the Jewish race as a race not suitable for immigration into South Africa This is the feature of the Bill that has been most discussed , most criticised , and I am glad to say most commended … [ In ] the 1930 Quota Act … the Jew was aimed at , but not specifically named In this Act he is specifically named Now the objection which is made is that in this Act I discriminate against the Jew as such I frankly admit that there is discrimination against the Jew as an immigrant , and against the Jew who is still an alien in South Africa And while on this question of discrimination , let me point out this to those newspapers , and to those who have been the most violent critics of my Bill , that they themselves practise a form of discrimination against the Jew — not the man who is coming in , not the Jew who is an alien , but the old-established Jew These very people are practising a form of discrimination which , in my opinion , hurts the Jew in his self-respect and pride far more than anything in the Bill I refer to social discrimination That is being practised every day The same man who writes the editorial criticising my Bill : the same man who gets on a platform and makes a speech in defence of the Jew Those same men will not propose a Jew as a member of their exclusive clubs … These same people who call me intolerant , and accuse me of discrimination , speak contemptuously of the Jews as "" Yids "" when they are in private conversation among themselves , or having a drink together I have been accused of anti-Semitism , and what not , but let me say in all sincerity that I have never yet in private conversation spoken of a Jew as a "" Yid . These people who pose as friends of the Jews are the same people who are practising social discrimination against the Jews in South Africa And it is not only in South Africa , it is the same in America … I say that such an attitude on the part of those who are to-day accusing me of anti-Semitism , of racialism and intolerance , is nothing but rank hypocrisy Furthermore , it is not fair to the Jews themselves It places the Jew in a false position ; it gives him a false sense of security , and afterwards when he wakes up and finds that there is a certain amount of anti-Jewish feeling in the country , then he is surprised , because to his face he has been told one thing , and behind his back another attitude is adopted Such hypocrisy complicates an already serious problem My Bill certainly does not suffer from hypocrisy It is characterised by complete candour and frankness But unfortunately candour and frankness is very often mistaken for hostility Why is this principle of discrimination introduced into my Bill Because in the first place the Jew is not assimilable … That the Jew is not assimilable has been shown from the records of history , and it is also admitted by the Jew himself Secondly , this Bill discriminates against the Jewish immigrant and Jewish alien , because owing to certain racial characteristics he creates a problem in any country as soon as the Jewish population exceeds a certain percentage of the total Thirdly , because in South Africa the Jewish population has already reached that percentage , and consequently we have with us to-day a Jewish problem which must be squarely faced I will deal first with assimilation , because that is the basic principle of my Bill That is no new principle It has been already adopted by the South African Paliament … But in the Act of 1937 it was left to the Selection Board to decide whether or not a particular race or person is assimilable … When , therefore , it is known from the record of history , and from the frank admission of its members , that a certain race is not readily assimilable ; when we know from our own observation that such a race has not been absorbed by either the English-speaking or by the Dutch-speaking section of the population , then the time has arrived that the board must receive instructions by legislation that such a race is not assimilable … My contention is that the Jewish race , taken as a whole , is not readily absorbed by either the Dutch or English-speaking sections in South Africa I know there are exceptions , there are exceptions to every rule , and so also there have been exceptions in the case of the Jewish race But let us look at history Since the Great Dispersion , for a period of over two thousand years , the Jew has wandered over the face of the earth , and to-day he is found in all countries of the globe ; but throughout the ages , scattered as he is to-day over the face of the earth , he has always remained a Jew You don't speak of a Jew in England as an Englishman , or in Holland as a Dutchman , or in France as a Frenchman No , you speak of him as an English Jew , a Dutch Jew or a French Jew He has maintained his racial identity and his Jewish customs , he has remained true to the faith of his forefathers , he has maintained the purity of his Jewish blood , and above all he has remained a separate nation … The reason is apparent Read through the Old Testament , the Laws of Moses I could quote dozens of texts to show that the Jew received strict injunctions that he should not mix with the nations amongst whom he lived … For centuries at a time the Jews have lived in circumstances favourable to absorption There were times when they were persecuted in certain countries and also in Great Britain , but there have also been long periods when they have lived under favourable circumstances in Great Britain and elsewhere , and yet they were not absorbed Even in America , the so-called melting-pot of the world , they have remained a separate nation The Jew has a remarkable aptitude of being able to adapt himself to his environment , of being able to adopt the customs and the ways of living of the people amongst whom he lives , of being able to acquire the veneer of the people amongst whom he lives That is where people make a mistake They think that is absorption It is nothing of the kind It is merely the facility of the Jew to adapt himself to his environment What is Zionism but the refusal of the Jew to assimilate , and that was the idea of Theodor Herzl , the founder of the movement Mr . Speaker , the Jew is a nomad by nature I am not saying that in an unfavourable sense I am not comparing the Jew with the gypsy ; but the history of the Jew is a history of his wandering among the nations of the earth The Jew is a cosmopolitan The Jew looks forward to that time when there will be re-established a Jewish state where he will await the coming of the Messiah But let the Jew speak for himself I don't want to weary the House with quotations , but I think it is necessary to hear what leading Jews say These books from which I shall quote are to be found in the parliamentary library Ludwig Lewissohn , a well-known Jewish writer , says — Assimilation is impossible , because the Jew cannot change his national character He goes on further and says — Assimilation is bankrupt Germany was the great laboratory experiment , and I think that the experiment was necessary , but it failed Then there is another book , The Real Jew , written by H . Newman , with an introduction by Israel Zangwill What does he say \xad — In examining the causes which have served to keep the Jews "" a people apart "" we find that deeply engraved in the soul of the Jewish people there are certain fundamental ideals ..These created an impassable barrier between their own deeply-rooted ideas of life and those of the surrounding peoples Thus whereas the Flemings , the Normans and the Huguenots were able wholly to assimilate with the English race at various epochs in their history , the Jews have never been able to merge themselves in their new environment to the same extent Then , sir , I find in A Book of Jewish Thoughts by Dr . J . H . Hertz , I think he was Chief Rabbi at one time , a chapter headed "" The Tragedy of Assimilation . He says — What I understand by assimilation is loss of identity It is the kind of assimilation that I dread most , even more than pogroms Then from Jewish Life in Modern Times , by Israel Cohen — However acute the divisions may be on the merits of orthodoxy , or on the virtue of the Zionist ideal , they are levelled by the influence of the past , which generates a spirit of solidarity welding the disparate units into a harmonious whole Opposed to the agencies consciously striving for the conservation of Jewry are forces working for its dissolution There is open advocacy of assimilation , viz . , that Jews should regard themselves as distinguished from their fellow-citizens merely in respect of religion , but that otherwise they should merge themselves completely in the general life of a nation in whose midst they dwell Thus the soul of Israel amongst the nations is nowhere immune from insidious assault Then I find that a distinguished Jew , Mr Basil M . Henriques made a speech in London which was reported in the Zionist Record of South Africa of the 29th January last , and he says — There must be no assimilation We are a peculiar people , and a peculiar people we must remain I find also in the Zionist Record an article by Mr . Ludwig Lewissohn He says — Men exist in groups that create their cultures in their own image , and as the expression of their permanent character Men exist in no other way Neither do Jews We are a culture-group ; we are a people ; we are a nationality No , don't stick your head into the sand at this point ""It's so silly , and so unrealistic , and so cowardly We are a nationality And so , Mr . Speaker , when one examines the writings of Jewish writers , of those who have spoken on behalf of their race , one finds them fighting against this idea of assimilation I repeat : the history of the Jews in those countries in which they have lived under favourable circumstances , show that they cannot be absorbed by other races They may absorb others , but they themselves cannot be absorbed It is also clear from their own admissions and statements that they do not wish to be absorbed In the second place it is necessary to discriminate against Jewish immigrants and the alien Jew in South Africa because , owing to certain racial characteristics and habits , the Jew creates a problem , as soon as his numbers unduly increase What happens is that you have an alien body in the general body of the state , and , as in the human organism , such an alien body causes irritation and friction , and results in inflammation and disease That is what has happened in many other countries , and that is what is happening in South Africa today What are those racial characteristics In the first place the Jew is international He is international in his outlook , and furthermore , he is part of a vast inter-locked organization His race is spread over the globe , a race that is bound by ties of culture , religion and blood to which add the bonds of finance and commerce and industry The Jew , in the first instance , is loyal to his own people , loyal to Israel , and what Israel stands for In the second place he is concerned mainly with his own personal and material interests May I refer to the position during the Great War in England It explains this characteristic of the Jew If one reads the post-war books it is perfectly clear that there was something wrong , especially during the earlier years of the war Jewry believed that the central powers were going to win the war , and therefore the majority of Jews were backing the central powers It was perfectly clear that things were going wrong in England , for instance with regard to supplies of foodstuffs , and that the blockade of Germany was ineffectual It was later discovered that there was disloyalty on the part of some of the Jews in London and elsewhere It will be recollected that Sir Edgar Spear , a privy councillor , was later deprived of his naturalization certificate and of his honours , because it was proved that he was a member of the coterie of Jewish financiers who were working against the interests of England Then the position became so acute that the British Government was obliged to do something in order to secure the support of the Jews It was during the most critical period of the war What did they do It came in the form of the Balfour Declaration on Palestine That declaration was not merely a happy idea on the part of Mr . Balfour It was necessary for England to enlist Jewish help The Jews were against England , but the Jew was prepared to give his help to the allied cause for a price , and the price that the British Government paid was the Balfour Declaration … Again we have the matter of the boycott against German goods … The hon member for Cape Town ( Castle ) denied that the Jewish community had anything to do with the Jewish boycott in this country , and said that the Jews themselves merely decided not to buy German goods He received support from the hon member for Benoni ( Mr . Madeley ) who said that his party had been responsible for the boycott If the hon member for Benoni , or if the South African Trades and Labour Council wish to suggest that this German boycott originated with them , then in the language of the classics I say : "" Go and tell that to the Marines . The idea originated with the Jews and with the Jewish Board of Deputies , and they used the South African Trades and Labour Council for the purpose of initiating this boycott I have before me a circular which was sent to a Gentile firm calling upon them to boycott German goods and also warning them not to advertise in a German paper published in Johannesburg The circular ends by saying — Do you know that the Jewish community will see to it that your firm is boycotted if you continue to advertise in the Deutsch-Afrikaner of Pretoria I have also the envelope addressed to the firm in question That was the way the boycott was carried on It is still being carried on today I have here a notice which is put on orders which are sent overseas , in the following form — Acceptance of goods will be refused if the goods are shipped by a German vessel , or through a German port or insured with a German company Now , sir , when the Jew buys goods for his own personal use he is perfectly entitled to do that if he wishes , but in this case he is not buying goods for his own consumption , but goods which are sold to the Gentile population I have the "" Boycott Bulletin "" which I read last year The hon member for Cape Town ( Castle ) said it was published in England It was published in England , but it was distributed in South Africa The boycott is a favourite weapon which is used by Jewry , and it is an efficient weapon from their point of view , because of the control they exercise on trade and industry Allow me to say , and I say it with a full sense of responsibility , to the Jewish population of South Africa , that in making use of this boycott weapon in connection with trade , or in connection with Press advertisements , they are playing with fire , they are using a double-edged weapon I say that the time will come when the people of South Africa will turn , and will not tolerate that sort of weapon being used in our country I think that it is well that that word of warning should be sounded to the Jewish community in South Africa … Another racial characteristic of the Jews which causes friction is the way in which the Jewish people seek to secure control of finance and business , the formation of monopolies , and also the domination of the professions This is particularly so with regard to high finance and international banking It is unnecessary to enter into that I am sure that the members of the Jewish race themselves , will admit that they control high finance and international banking in Europe and in America Remember that the international banker controls credit , and in that way through his control of credit , he is also able to exercise control over industry and trade International finance and industry and trade are thus closely related In the United States the Jews have already managed to secure control of a number of the most important industries in the country , finance , the wholesale and retail trade , the garment trade , motion pictures , furniture and liquor trade , and so on To a large extent the same thing has happened in England But let us come to South Africa One has only to go about the country to see to what extent the Jew is controlling retail and wholesale business in South Africa He controls the liquor trade There is a body known as the South African Board of Distilleries , which is almost entirely controlled by Jews There is amongst them a certain Mr Ashton , who figures as a director , but I find that his real name is Aronson To a large extent the Jew controls the meat trade , and he almost entirely controls the theatre and cinema business He exercises a large measure of control over the hotel trade and shirt manufacture In the retail tobacco trade it is the same thing , and then one has only to look to the enormous economic control exercised by a prominent Jew , Mr I . W . Schlesinger , to realise to what lengths this has gone Not content with the control of finance and business , the Jew is now turning to the professions I have gone through the telephone list very carefully in Johannesburg and Cape Town , and have taken only those names which I am quite sure are Jewish What do I find That in Johannesburg 65 per cent of the attorney firms are Jewish ; of the advocates 45 per cent are Jewish ; in Cape Town the attorneys are 41 per cent , and the advocates 28 per cent I have here the list of the law certificate examination results of January of this year Forty-Four percent of the successful candidates in the Law Certificate examination were Jews … As regards medical practitioners , in Johannesburg 48 percent are Jews , and that , I am informed , is a very conservative estimate , because I have not included the names of persons who have changed their names In Cape Town at least 31 per cent of the medical practitioners are Jews In the Witwaterstrand University Final Examination , \xad 68 per cent of the successful medical students were Jews In Cape Town the percentage was 32 per cent I am informed that in the first , second and third year classes the percentage is even higher But , sir , it is not only in business and the professions where the Jew occupies a position out of all proportion \xad to his percentage of the population We find him also in positions of authority That is particularly so in England and America That was particularly the case in England during the period of the Great War In the Lloyd George Cabinet there were several Jews The Spectator , in an editorial in 1920 , wrote — We are convinced that at the present moment persons of the Jewish faith are far too numerous in our Cabinet We have got a great many more Jews than we deserve The Spectator probably also had in mind the Marconi scandal which had taken place not long before , in which several prominent Jews were implicated [ Now ] Jews often ask , "" Why is the gentile unable to compete with the Jew Is it not the fault of the gentile himself ? That charge has often been leveled Let me frankly admit that the Jew is a very clever and adroit business man , but there are other reasons why the gentile finds it difficult to compete with him Firstly , as regards international trade and finance , there is the fact that the Jew is international , and has international affiliations As regards inland trade , there is that racial cement , that bond of racial unity which enables the Jew to make arrangements which it is impossible for the gentile to make under similar circumstances And finally , let me add this , namely , that in his business dealings with the gentile the Jew undoubtedly has a different outlook and a different business standard I don't want to go too deeply into that aspect , as I do not wish to hurt the susceptibilities of members of this House who are Jews … I suggest to anybody who wishes to go into the matter further , to study the Talmud , and he will find some light thrown on the question as to why the Jew is able to compete so successfully with the gentile Another habit of the Jew which creates trouble and friction , especially when his numbers exceed a certain percentage , is the Jewish habit of secrecy That aptitude of the Jew of being able to conceal what he wishes to keep secret , especially when it is in his own interests , was probably initiated during the period of persecutions , but it has remained a habit of the Jew , and has become almost a national instinct … This habit of concealment takes another form in the changing of names Why does the Jew change his name It is in order to give an outward appearance of having been assimilated The hon member for Troyeville ( Mr Kentridge ) admitted during the 1937 debate why he changed his name Some remark was made about his having changed his name , and he said that he did it to show that he had been assimilated But the hon member remains the same Jew that he was , whether he is called Kentridge or Kantorovitch Another reason why the Jew changes his name is to secure certain advantages of a business or a social nature , and that is happening in South Africa I put a question to the hon the Minister the other day I took at random two cases which I happened to find in the Government Gazette where two Jews had changed their names I asked what were "" the good and sufficient reasons "" postulated by the Act for the change of the name Cohen , and the Minister replied that this particular person had changed his name "" for business , social and personal reasons . I submit that it was not the intention of the Act that a man should be permitted to change his name for such reasons When a man changes his name for business reasons he is practising deception upon his customers and upon the people in the town where he does business ; and I say to the Minister that he was not acting according to the spirit and according to the letter of the Act of 1937 when he allowed that man and others to change their names for business , social and personal reasons That is not a good and sufficient reason under that Act Mr Speaker , I have shown that the Jew is unassimilable , and that he has certain racial characteristics I have shown that when the Jewish population figure reaches a certain percentage of the population of a state , it causes trouble That is also the view of the Jews themselves The great leader of Jewish Zionism , Dr Herzl , is quoted in the South African Jewish Chronicle , of the 25th of May , 1934 \xad — Herzl foresaw long ago that the percentage of Jews that a country can absorb before anti-Semitism sets in is very low , barely five per cent After that a saturation sets in , the weather breaks , and threatening storms appear on the horizon Here in South Africa the Jewish population exceeds that percentage of safety The saturation point was reached some time ago , and the storm clouds are not merely on the horizon , they have already moved up I am not going to enter into discussion on figures , I am not going to ask whether in this year more Jews were allowed in than in another year , because that is beside the point , in view of the terms of my Bill , which says that no further Jewish immigration should be allowed in South Africa But what I do say is that , having regard to the state of the problem , and the serious proportions it has attained in South Africa , we have to ask three questions : What is the Jewish population in South Africa ; what percentage of the total white population does that constitute , and , finally , is it being fed by further immigration It is difficult to arrive at a definite figure as to what the South African Jewish population is to-day … In November , 1936 , the Jewish Board estimated that the Jewish population was 95,000 Add to those figures , the immigration figures of the Selection Board , allow a percentage for those who do not attend the synagogue , and for "" visitors "" and "" in transit "" immigrants , allow also for the natural increase , because the Jews live according to the Mosaic laws , which tell them to be fruitful and to multiply … On this basis I think it can be safely said that on a conservative estimate the Jewish population must be to-day between 98,000 and 100,000 , and that brings us to 5 per cent of the white population of South Africa South Africa has in actual numbers a larger Jewish population than fifteen European countries … Our attitude , sir , the attitude of the Nationalist Party , is that the Jewish population of South Africa is already too large It has exceeded the danger point percentage As far as I am concerned it is no good telling me that during this or that year immigration was so much less , or was only so much Even if the number of immigrants were one hundred per annum , I say that they are one hundred too many , in view of the fact that saturation point has been reached , in the words of Dr . Herzl , the leader of the Zionist Movement We say that Jewish immigration must be completely stopped I maintain , Mr . Speaker , that that is the view , not only of those of us who sit on this side of the House , but I am convinced that that is the view which is shared by the great majority of the English and Dutch-speaking people in South Africa I say that the time has arrived when we have to deal frankly with this problem We owe it to our children , and it is only fair to the Jewish population themselves , to let them know where they stand , to deal openly and frankly and honestly with them This Bill of mine , contrary to the criticisms which have been made in the Press , does not touch the old-established Jew in South Africa It is aimed to prevent any further Jewish immigration It is further aimed at the alien Jew at present in South Africa May I commend , sir , to this House and also to hon members who are Jews , and to Jews outside of this House , the words of a man who is a friend of the Jews , the words of Hilaire Belloc He says — There is a Jewish problem , and the Jews who resent the statement of the problem , and an attempt at solving it , are not doing their own people any good , and they are at the same time denying us the right to put our house in order , which denial is of course intolerable [ I ] say , sir , to the Government and to hon members on that side of the House that if their Jewish supporters decline to see reason , then you owe it to the country to eliminate this factor from party political considerations You owe it to the pioneers of the Great Trek , whose Centenary we recently celebrated , and you owe it to the pioneers of the 1820 settlers , these English and Dutch-speaking pioneers who left a heritage for their descendants in our country I say further , you owe it to the people of South Africa , and you owe it to future generations of South Africans to tackle this problem now , before it is too late I say to the Jewish members of this House and to the Jewish community outside the House , "" In your own interests , beware that you do not put anything in the way of the tackling of this problem I say to you , read the history of your own race and people , and be satisfied with the numbers that you have in the country today . When Mr . Louw had finished his speech , he was attacked from all quarters , both inside and outside the House of Deputies Some members of his own Nationalist Party did rise to defend him , mainly by repeating some of his most telling points , though one deputy introduced some challenging remarks to the effect that Jews had had a hand in fomenting the Boer War Another of Louw's backers quoted President Kruger , the hero of the Boers , as follows : If it were possible to throw the Jewish monopolists root and branch out of our country without causing a war with England , then the question of everlasting peace in South Africa would be solved What was most ironic about the Jewish and liberal attacks on Mr . Louw was that all the humanitarian and democratic clich és in behalf of Jews and of Jewish immigration came from the mouths of people who benefited politically and financially from the system of apartheid , which legalized the second-class status of Blacks From listening to them one would have thought they were all members of an equalitarian human rights paradise that would have won the approval of Jesus Christ himself After hearing all the arguments on the other side and after several postponements , Mr . Louw rose to make his final plea : Hon members will realise that in connection with such an important matter , and seeing that attacks on the Bill have been made from all sides of the House , that I must have a reasonable opportunity to reply to such attacks and arguments What particularly struck me in connection with the debate of the Bill is the great interest that was taken by the public during the debate , and also the space that was given to it in the Press of the country It clearly appears from that that the public of South Africa feels strongly in regard to the Jewish question By that interest it is admitted that we are dealing with a burning question , and let me tell hon members , especially those on the other side of the House , that this feeling is not restricted to one section of the population Since the Bill was published , and since the debate here took place , I have had numbers and numbers of letters and telegrams from all parts of the country , and eight out of every ten of the letters and telegrams came from English-speaking people As we are concerned with such an important matter which affects the future of our children in South Africa , it is tragic that the attitude of the Government should be influenced and settled by the question of political advantage of Jewish assistance at elections That is the motive which guides the attitude of hon members opposite , that is what influences them … On the public platforms , and in the House of Assembly the impression is created as if the object was to start a persecution of the old-established Jewish population Anyone who reads the Bill will see that that is not so The main principle of the Bill is to put a stop to further Jewish immigration , and in the second place it embraces the principle that Jews who are still aliens , who have not yet become naturalised , and who entered the country since 1930 , shall be treated in a particular way But yet we find that the Minister , the man who we would have expected to make a study of the Bill , talks here of Jewish persecution … One of the other characteristics of the debate on previous occasions , and also to-day , is the fact that those who have taken part in it did not go into the merits of the matter , but they confined themselves to generalities They did not deal with the question of the position of the Jews in South Africa , and debate this question on its merits , nor the role that is being played by the Jew , or the danger which the question will be in the future to us as well as to the Jews themselves Those questions have not been gone into So also we find , for instance , that the Minister of the Interior said not a word about the question of assimilation , which surely is the basic principle of this Bill He simply makes the statement , namely , that I would be surprised to see how many marriages were taking place between Jews and Christians … For the rest , with regard to the speech of the Minister of the Interior , it was a repetition of the old stories of intolerance , of democracy , of discrimination and the like … It is no use coming to this House and mentioning the names of fifteen or twenty Jews in South Africa who have become more or less assimilated , and to forget the enormous number of 99,990 who have not It is no argument to prove that the Jew , as such , is assimilable … A difference is drawn by them between the Jewish men who came in and the women and children who came in later I must admit that I cannot see the validity of such an argument If the family comes in with the husband , then they are counted together as Jews who have come into the country What difference does it make then if the father comes in advance to spy out the land , and his wife and children follow two , three or five months later They are just as much Jewish immigrants as he is I really cannot see the force of that argument ; it simply will not hold water Then he and other hon members also used the argument of the great value the Jews were to the country , how the Jews had the initiative in connection with the establishment of industries , provided work for our people , and also raised the standard of living in the country There again you have an argument which I personally , and others also , cannot follow — we can not agree to the argument that those industries would not have been established if it were not for the Jews Take the shirt factories This industry was started by Christians and to-day as far as I know , only one [ factory ] has continued to remain in Christian hands The others are all in Jewish hands , or had to make way for Jewish undertakings To tell us that we should allow still more Jews into the country because the Jew has initiative is no argument The Englishman , e . g has just as much initiative so far as industries are concerned , as any other race in the world If the Jew had not established those industries , then the Englishman would have done so , but at the moment they have to take a back place to the Jews And is it correct that the standard of living is being increased by the Jews owing to their participation in industry Take a report which we had a few days ago in the newspapers with regard to a certain Jewish woman who was up before the court , and she was convicted and heavily fined because she compelled girls to pay back a part of their wages I am told by persons who are engaged in our industries , that such practices are a great evil in the industries , and a large section of the people who are guilty of those evils are precisely these Jews who have come into the country during the past years … But then I want to point out to the hon member that the Jewish question is not a question of religion , but a question of race Marx was therefore a Jew , whether he was converted or not And then it is also said that the Jews have not played an important role in Communism If the hon member for Bloemfontein ( City ) said that Karl Marx was not the spiritual father of Communism , then I can only say he apparently does not know what he is speaking about , and I would advise him to make a study of Communism … According to the statements of experts about what took place in Russia , it has been incontrovertibly proved that a large section of the communist committees consisted of Jews According to one authority there were in 1935 , 56 out of the 59 members of the Central Comintern , and I have already mentioned what I saw myself in regard to the Jews as Soviet ambassadors , and as representatives of Russia at the League of Nations Even in Germany Jews were the promoters of Communism I need only mention the names of Clara Zetkin , Rosa Luxemburg , Karl Liebknecht , Kurt Elsner , and Levi , and the same was the case in Hungary , where Bela Kun , formerly Cohen , was , the leader of the communist revolution He was also a Jew , and the Minister of Justice can testify that that was the bloodiest revolution which took place there He knows about it , because he was sent there by the Allied Powers to try and settle things In Spain you had the same thing There the communists were organised by Rosenberg , who went there as the ambassador of Russia , but in reality he had another object And we find the same thing in South Africa as well Here the leaders of the communists are Harry Snitcher , one Weinstein , one Kahn and one Cohen , and all are Jews We have therefore to deal with facts which cannot be denied But then it is asked why on the one hand it is said that the Jews are communists and on the other hand that the Jews are capitalists I know it appears to be a paradox , but one of the chief objects of communism is the control of the production and of the distribution By that the communists mean the control of distribution and of production by officials , and the officials , in turn , are usually Jews , who are also looking after their own pockets … But let us stick to historical facts , and then we find that as soon as the percentage of Jews in a country becomes too large you have had Jewish persecutions I am accused of all kinds of offences , anti-Semitism and even worse , but I say in all seriousness , that I , as a South African , am concerned about the growing Jewish population in South Africa , and if we do not take steps we shall have the same development in South Africa that there has already been in other countries I want to say to my hon friends there that they are making a mistake in thinking that there is not a strong and constantly growing anti-Semitic feeling in the country It has become plain to me from the large number of letters which I have received from the Union and from Rhodesia as well I say in all seriousness , as a South African , that if the Government shows that it really wants to put an end to the Jewish immigration into South Africa , and wants to take action against the alien Jew , it will then contribute in great measure to the reduction of the anti-Jewish feeling which we have in the country But as long as the Government does not take action , that feeling will increase and become worse , and the day will come when there will be an outburst , and the Government and hon members on that side will have to take responsibility for that And then , finally , there is the most important section in connection with the attacks on my Bill It is the Jewish members in this House … But what struck me … was that they did not say a single word about the main principle of my Bill , namely assimilation They absolutely neglected it , because they know that the statements which I made were not incorrect They know that the Jews cannot or will not assimilate , that the Jews consider themselves a separate nation , and that they want to remain a separate nation The chief characteristic of the speech of the hon member for Troyeville was not what he said , but what he did not say He says that the immigration is a small trickle , and he brings up the same old argument of the women and the children and the aged people … Then he says that the refugee question is an international matter It may be that it has international repercussions , but the question with which we have to deal to-day is an economic matter , which affects every man , woman and child in our country Therefore it is no good to get rid of the point by saying that we are dealing with an international question Then he says further that I quoted wrongly from certain Jewish writings , and in connection with that I will just confine myself to one example It is the case of my quotations from the book by Israel Cohen about the solidarity of Jewry In that book there is a chapter with the title of "" Solidarity . The hon member for Troyeville wants to make out that I did not quote everything , and that the solidarity of the Jews is only aimed at questions of charity , schools , etc Of course , I did not want to detain the House by quoting two or three pages , but what actually occurred is that the hon member for Troyeville only mentioned one or two of the characteristics of that solidarity But the hon member is very careful to quote everything which , according to him , I left out , because it says that the solidarity is not only confined to matters of religion , but that it must also stand on a solid foundation in regard to political and social questions Then the writer goes on and mentions the organisations which exist in different countries to promote immigration What I left out does not weaken my position , but on the contrary , it strengthens my argument … The hon member for Troyeville went further and questioned my figures in regard to the percentage of Jewish doctors and attorneys He asks why I went through the telephone book , and not the directory , or some other register Surely the telephone book was the best for the purpose , and if the hon member examines it , he will find that my percentages were not too high , but on the contrary were very conservative I have a list here in regard to Johannesburg alone of the number of doctors there Jewish doctors , who have changed their names , and one has even adopted a name with a hyphen to make it sound more truly English My figures are not only correct , but very conservative He asks why I only produced the figures for Johannesburg and Cape Town Surely that is where we have the greatest concentration of the population But even so far as the whole country is concerned , the percentage of the Jewish doctors is 26 per cent , and the hon member forgets that in the universities 50 per cent to 70 per cent of the medical students are Jewish , so that in future the percentage of Jewish doctors will rise still more Then the hon member says that the public service is closed to the Jews I don't know how he arrives at that It is indeed true that few Jews sit for the examination for admission to the public service , but that is because the monetary advantages from the public service are not sufficiently attractive for them Of course , you do not find them in the ordinary banks behind the counter as tellers , the Jews like to deal with money but not to count it for other people But although you do not see the Jew behind the counter in the ordinary commercial banks , you find him in control of the big financial houses in America and Europe , of the so-called acceptance houses in Europe , and of the big private banks I can mention a dozen names of large financial institutions in Europe which are in Jewish hands The Jewish financiers do actually control what is called "" big finance "" … [ Israel Cohen ] says that such assimilation is a danger to the soul of the people of Israel He complains of the fact that the Jews will lose their identity as a separate people — just as for instance the hon member for Johannesburg ( North ) has lost the German identity of his ancestors That is what is meant by assimilation , your absorption by the people amongst whom the immigrant goes to live We have the example of the Huguenots and the Germans , who identified themselves with the population of South Africa and were absorbed by the English-speaking and the Afrikaans-speaking people , and became "" one "" with them The hon member for Umlazi , says that anti-Semitism is "" manufactured "" in Germany May I give the Jewish members the advice to read a book which recently appeared by a well-known journalist , Sisley Huddleston , in which he tells of a conversation which he had with prominent Jews in Geneva , and that the most important of them said [ re-translation ] \xad – What I hope is that Hitler will start a persecution of Jews , because we need it to bring us together again as one people That was a statement by a well-known and prominent Jew He interpreted what was undoubtedly in the minds of Jews , namely the maintenance of their identity as a separate people Now I come to the hon member for Cape Town ( Castle ) He quoted what I am supposed to have said about Zionism It is not for me to criticise Zionism , it is a matter for the Jews If they think that the Jewish people will find their salvation in the new Palestine , in the new Jerusalem then it is their business It is not for me or other Christians to criticise it But what I did say and still say is that the Zionist movement testifies to the fact that the Jews do not want to assimilate , that they want to remain a separate people Otherwise you could not have such a movement That is all the hon member said about assimilation You will always find that on this question the basic principle of my Bill will be very hesitatingly referred to by the Jews and others They are very much afraid of that point … I must express my regret at having detained the House so long , but in the circumstances it was necessary to deal with the matter that has been raised here I would like to make an appeal to hon members opposite at any rate to show in connection with this matter at least that they have the courage of their convictions It is no use saying as has been said by members of the Government that they are not divided on the matter We know that they are We can mention names to prove it but I will not do so … Here we have a Bill which provides a means of settling the Jewish question in South Africa It is no use for hon members to go to the country or to their constituencies , and to say that they also are in favour of stopping Jewish immigration , but that they voted against the Bill , because there was something here or there that they could not support They know quite well that they can agree to the principle of the Bill , and that they could then bring up any amendments about which they could convince the House in the committee stage They will admit that the main principle of it is the stopping of further Jewish immigration into South Africa I hope that hon members will understand this quite well , and I hope that there are some in their party who will have the courage of their convictions and will show that they agree with us in regard to the great matter , a matter which not only affects us to-day but which is becoming worse from day to day and which will affect future generations , their children and children's children … We … have brought forward a clear policy and if the Government party rejects this measure , the responsibility will rest on the shoulders of the Government and the Government party , for what may occur now or in the future When Mr . Louw sat down the deputies voted His bill was defeated 81 to 17 The 81 noes were registered by all the English-speaking members , all the Jewish members and a half-dozen or so Afrikaners The 13 ayes came entirely from Afrikaners And so ended a little-known legislative battle that went to the very heart of Western civilization The immigration laws of other White countries began to crumble in the decades after Mr . Louw's gallant but losing attempt to protect South Africa's European genetic and cultural heritage Mr . Louw , who was really speaking for Whites everywhere , felt that his country had the right to lock its doors against strange-looking intruders Unfortunately , not enough of his fellow leaders were sufficiently brave and uncorrupted Soon we may all find that we will not only be forbidden to lock our country's doors against outsiders , as has already proved to be the case , but also the doors of our own homes "" Gun control "" in one sense is nothing but tampering with the lock on our front door Mr . Louw's story , however , has one happy note The Afrikaners did not let the Jews frighten them into making Louw a pariah Though some voted against him , most of them stuck by him and , as their influence rose in the South African state , Louw through the years was given several important diplomatic and cabinet posts , including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Eric Louw died on June 24 , 1968 "
1,"ONE correspondent , O . R . , writes to us about our news reporting on NationalVanguard.org , specifically commenting on our coverage of European nationalist parties : "" There's an issue with the National Vanguard Web site that has been bothering me lately , i . e . , its favorable articles towards nominally-nationalistic European parties that allow non-Whites , including Jews , to join and hold office ""I'm aware that this issue ( i . e . , Kosher Nationalist parties ) has been discussed in depth in other forums , but I think it is necessary to discuss NV's apparent support for these parties … "" Does NV support these parties I know they rely on freelance writers for many of their articles , so it is not clear if they are simply publishing what they are sent , or if they publish only what they endorse If the former , they should at least provide a disclaimer stating the fundamental flaws of the multi-racialism , conservatism , and Jew-friendly policies of these parties "" Despite the denials of many wishful-thinkers , these right-wing European parties are primarily geographic and  or cultural nationalists They are not White nationalists One of their main points is to crack down on "" Islamic extremism . Now , obviously , none of us want Muslims or non-Whites in Europe But to focus on the "" Islamic extremists "" as the primary threat is doing the work of the Jews It ignores the looming demographic racial disaster and the reasons behind it And it focuses energy against the non-Whites who do not subscribe to the New World Order and will not move in next door and marry White women In other words , it focuses on the least dangerous of the non-Whites , and the ones that the Jews oppose the most "" Some of these parties are strong supporters of democracy and assimilation of non-Whites Others are openly Zionist [ Some support ] ending immigration , and then integrating the non-Whites already present … "" It would be unfortunate if the National Alliance has shifted its ideology in support of conservative parties in Europe . Let me make one point very clear : The National Alliance stands alone and we do not endorse a conservative or populist approach to our race's problems , since such an approach is bound to fail We want a revolution in the hearts and minds of our people so we can remake our civilization into one which serves and protects the race Having said that , though , we do want and in fact encourage friendly relations with Whites of good will and racial consciousness no matter where they live , what language they speak , what their economic status may be , or what political party or group they may belong to But we do not officially endorse or support any party or any group except the National Alliance As our founder William Pierce expressed many times , and as I maintain on this radio program and in our other media : The National Alliance is unique And it is uncompromising in its principles We maintain that Whites are the descendants of the race that developed in Europe over many millennia and created Western civilization We maintain that the Jewish race is an alien , unassimilable race and its international power structure is now by far the greatest threat to our survival And we maintain that our unalterable goal is White living space , freedom and self-determination for our people in a state which makes racial survival , racial integrity , and racial progress its highest and non-negotiable goals Our definition of ourselves is a biological definition , a racial definition , and religion and geography have nothing to do with it No biological Jew , nor any member of the African or Asian races can be "" converted "" into one of us as one can be converted to a religion No one not clearly of European stock can be a member of our people — and , as National Vanguard writer Mike Rienzi has pointed out , we will soon have the technology to accurately test for this Citizenship must be based on descent , not on an accident of geography or on artificial lines drawn on a map Assimilation of immigrants can work for immigrants of various nationalities but of the same race — as America proves But it does not work for members of radically different races , as America also proves Attempting to integrate the radically different Mestizos and Blacks into Euro-American society has been a total failure The founding fathers and American patriots of many generations warned us of this , as the Alliance continues to warn us today An even greater failure was the importation of an even more dangerous race — the Jews — who , unlike the Blacks and Mestizos , had the advantage of similar skin color to ours and quite high average intelligence The Jewish consciousness of their racial difference from us , and their desire to survive as a unique and dispersed people , were bars to assimilation and , more than that , were spurs to a sub rosa war on Whites that has yet to reach its conclusion So why do we report on — and republish reports from — nationalist parties in Europe or elsewhere who do not have the same uncompromising principles we have Before I tell you the main reason for that , let me say one thing about these parties We maintain open communication with many of them We want to know everything that's going on in their countries that impacts White people or the ability of White people to tell the truth about race and Jewish power Reports from these parties are useful for this purpose ; and many of them are worthy of publication And we know from these communications that many of the members of these parties are themselves far more radical than the milquetoast platforms the parties publish We also know that some , though far from all , of the top leaders of these parties are more radical than they believe it is politic to say or espouse publicly In some cases , they must tone down their rhetoric in order to stay out of jail in countries that don't have a first amendment , in countries where even expressing one's racial feelings or telling the truth about Jewish power is an indictable offense In some cases , however , the party leaders , though they may love their own people , really do wrongly believe that a racially mixed Europe is acceptable as long as it doesn't "" go too far "" and that a modus vivendi can be reached with the Jewish supremacists Even in these cases , though , we want to maintain open contact with members and officials of these generally White-friendly parties Our mission is educating and inspiring White people to understand our people's plight , to understand what our options really are , and to do the right thing We can't do that if we make enemies of good-hearted people who haven't yet reached a mature understanding of these things When they are ready — and we are making more and more of them ready every day — they will join us "

1,"The National Socialist Movement ( NSM  NSM88.ORG ) is regretful over the unnecessary loss of life in Charleston , South Carolina We must remind all Americans that we have repeatedly warned of an escalation in ethnic violence , if the current policies of the current administration are not revised to suit the best interests of ALL Americans The epidemic of rapes and murders committed by Blacks against Whites on a daily basis have been systematically repressed by the mainstream media and ignored by the immediate-past Holder Justice Department , as well as under the current Attorney General The recent anarchy in Ferguson – and now Baltimore – have made it clear to all Americans that President Obama will do nothing to defend the best interests of White Americans Whites are simply getting fed up and their frustration over the government Disenfranchising them in their own nation will ultimately lead to a violent backlash which has been predicted by a number of pundits as well as leading military strategists 22 White Americans are killed every single day by Blacks and a White woman is raped every nine minutes by a Black in America How long do you think it will be before the day of reckoning will come Our organization does not condone or promote acts of violence against any organization or individual and indeed our entire platform has been to save lives by resolving the issues before we are faced with the prospect of all out Civil War brought on by multiculturalism , but we have stated time and again that the concerns of the White nationalists are going to have to be addressed if there is ever to be peace in this nation To borrow a line from the Black civil rights leaders , "" No Justice ; No Peace .

1,"One of my earliest memories is that of President John F . Kennedy's death being analyzed on television With cold accuracy , the experts – and the television cameras – hovered over a plastic model of the human brain , pointing with pens at the trajectory of the bullets that killed an beloved American leader As I sift through the beginnings of the inevitably increasing torrents of inevitable news reports , I am taken aback , shocked and saddened by the realization that a naturalized citizen had the incredibly unmitigated gall to kill four of America's finest soldiers It hurts even more to realize that all four were white men like myself Like probably all of us , I've had friends who have been in the military ""They're a brave , dedicated and focused lot Sure , some move towards the military as a ' last-ditch ' effort to save themselves from self-defeating behaviors or limited educations Even THOSE are transformed into exemplary citizens Imagine the MAJORITY who instead go into the armed services who HAVE MORE than the lowest common denominator that's recruitable Imagine the four Marines who were killed in Chattanooga this week by a shooter who was allegedly influenced by ISIS A ' journalist ' is not supposed to let tears well up But , a ' writer ' can So can a ' patriot . ' I pass an armed services recruiting office every week or two on my rounds to the ' dollar store , ' the ' big-box store , ' and whatever errands I have to fill my time with The recruiters and their friends who hang around that office are usually happy and healthy They unwittingly embarrass me while I'm chomping down on a moderately-glutinous foot-long sub sandwich , yet they ' indulge ' in a low - fat  protein-dense six-inch sub of their choice I am embarrassed , but ironically pleased Everything is as it SHOULD be Except in Chattanooga When will politicians realize that the American experience CANNOT continue with the polyglot of people who hate us When will they realize that it is NOT the Confederate Flag that incites violence , but the credo of third-world countries They are BEGINNING to realize this EXCECPT in Chattanooga John Donne , the English poet and a cleric in the Church of England ( considered the pre-eminent representative of the metaphysical poets ) once said , "" The death of any man diminishes me . Obviously , I am diminished right now ALL white people are diminished now Even journalists , writers , and patriots ESPECIALLY in Chattanooga "
1,"NSM Media honors these French white nationalist publications by paraphrasing their questions , and printing Commander Schoep's largely unedited initial replies The first question of the journalists is how Commander Schoep had come to national socialism from a pro-white perspective "" I had come to National Socialism at a very young age , but was not able to find any movement groups until I was around 17 years old At that time , it was not easy to find groups like it is now I found the NSM ( at that time the name was changed to NSAWFM ) Later when I was appointed to lead the organization , I changed it back to its original name National Socialist Movement . The next question predictably centers on George Lincoln Rockwell , his follows , and the possible plot regarding his murder "" George Lincoln Rockwell was the father of National Socialism in the U . S He linked most of fair right movements and created some kind of an American National Socialism . "" Commander Rockwell was the founder of post-World War II American National Socialism Before him , there was the German American Bund , and also the Silver Shirts of William Dudley Pelley We honor Commander Rockwell , and are the only existing American National Socialist group that has direct ties to Commander Rockwell besides the New Order – who also have ties to Commander Rockwell The man who murdered him was John Patler , who was a traitor who felt he knew better than Commander Rockwell , and assassinated him From my understanding , Patler did almost no time in jail for the murder , and was released and was hidden under a new name If he is still alive , he is living under a fake name somewhere . The magazines ' authors note the increase in public demonstrations , membership , and media coverage for the NSM ( "" even in France , we heard about you ! The next questions about about more specifics of the NSM "" We have been very fortunate to have a good team of National Socialists who are very active and ... visible in the streets A lot of Americans are afraid to take to the streets and will not do much actively ; we are the opposite and we get out there We also use the internet , our record label ( nsm88records.com ) , our social networking site ( newsaxon.org ) – currently offline , but is coming back very soon , perhaps by the time this interview airs , and we also pass out literature We have also released two video games - - "" Zogs Nightmare : 1 and 2 . We are active on the Southern USA borders doing patrols in very dangerous areas where the U . S . government posts signs warning people not to travel in those areas due to the drug cartels and drug smuggling operations We send men into those areas in order to halt drug trafficking and illegal immigration into our nation Those are just a few examples of things the NSM does We are also very active in public protests and marches , and we do run people for public office . The next questions centered around the late Jeff Hall "" Jeff Hall was an amazing activist for the NSM , and he obtained over 30 % of the vote when he ran for [ a local ] public office He organized countless rallies for the party , and was highly active in our border patrol operations as well He is greatly missed in the organization It is a hard subject for me to speak about , because Jeff was not just a valuable NSM member , but he was also a good friend , and he is greatly missed His death was a very strange situation that no one could really explain , other than it was horrible and unimaginable American national socialism suffered a great loss that day , as did Jeff's family It is a tragedy . Now , about Dylann Roof ... "" The National Socialist Movement does not support what Dylann Roof is alleged to have done It is said that he targeted innocent people who were attending church , which is not something a white warrior would do The current USA ZOG system has reacted by attempting to ban the Rebel flag , which is part of white heritage here in our nation In fact , I have just returned from a rally at the South Carolina State Capitol in defense of the flag We just put up videos , pictures , and an after action report on our website nsm88.org from the South Carolina rally A Race war in this nation is something we feel could happen at any time , of course we do not wish for that , but if it happens we will be ready for it , and the white race will survive and flourish no matter what . How about President Obama and his economic policies ' hitting home ? ' "" Many , many people in this city [ Detroit ] are out of work , and one of the best examples I can give is a comrade who came to visit here He had been in London during World War II , and stated that large parts of Detroit reminded him of London after the German bombings ... due to the ruined homes , and neighborhoods here Detroit is a very dangerous and violent city , so for us being based here its right in the heart of America's problems , a good place to be to make change . "" What is National Socialism for you , "" and how does it work with religion and other like - minded groups "" National Socialism for me is a way of life , and we hope to install those values in all of our folk In regards to religion , the NSM does not promote or endorse any specific religion If I was to make a guess , I would say about 45 % of our membership is Pagan , 45 % Christian , and 10 % other religions or no religion Currently in the USA , we do sometimes work with the KKK There are many factions of the Klan – some are friendly to NS and others see it as against America or some other crazy thinking I am of the school of thought where we all had better find our common ground and fight together , or we face extinction as a people Anyone who is fighting among ourselves and dividing over minor issues , such as religion or whatever issue is , only serving the enemy and is not our folk . "" Could you describe the majors nationalist movements "" and other related organizations "" We do have different factions and groups here , and each of those ... also have some splinter factions within those groups as well The National Socialist Movement does not have any splinter factions , nor do we tolerate anyone attempting to split our group into pieces Regarding the other organizations , I cannot say that I pay much attention to what is going on in them We have friends and comrades in all of the different factions , and we welcome almost all of them to work with us or attend things we do if they wish to do so Our hand of comradeship is extended to them all The only people we will not work with is those who seek to cause division , or harbor sex offenders , or if they openly work to cause problems among the white organizations With that said , anyone who does that , we feel is probably working for ZOG It is too late in the fight for our race to have anyone around who would seek to divide us from within Regarding the criminal organizations , its really not the same as the rest of the groups , as the rest of the organizations stay within legal guidelines , the criminal ones operate completely different , and we do not really have any connection to that . What about European Nationalists "" I understand that some European Nationalists do not like America , mostly because of American support of Israel ( Occupied Palestine ) , however I have never understood why some of them do not like American Nationalists , as we fight the ZOG system , we are no different The difference though between American Nationalists and European Nationalists is that so many Americans absolutely refuse to get active in the streets The NSM is one of the few groups left in the USA that still do street activism There are a few others who do fight alongside of us , but the fact that so many American Nationalists only want to be active on the internet and not in real life , or they just want to hang out and drink and talk about the problems , we face is a major problem within the U . S . movement It keeps us weaker than we should be , and its shameful that any strong white person would have an excuse for being a coward , or inactive in the real fight when our race and our rights are being taken away With that being said , perhaps that is why some European Nationalists do not like the American Movement Personally , I know that myself and those who actively stand with us here do our part and we battle the reds and Antifa in the streets , and we are well known for that I will make no excuse for the lazy , fat , out-of-shape , or cowardly internet warriors here in the USA , for their lack of action But I will continue to do my part and push everyone I know of to do the same for our race and nation . And what of France "" I really did not know that Zionists are so heavily involved over there But in typical Jewish tactics of divide-and-conquer , I am not surprised The Jews play both sides of the fence so they can remain safe I have noticed that the Jews are heavily involved in attempting to get white activists to focus on Muslims , which takes the spotlight off of the Jew My advice is never ever remove the bright shining light off of the Jew , for it is the Jew that is the true enemy of all humanity on this planet All the other races and racial problems we have go back to the Jew , and the focus should never be removed from them Sure , in American we have problems with black people , everyone knows that , but how did they get here Who enslaved them and owned the slave ships Jews . Will liberal immigration in Europe "" destroy our racial and cultural heritage ... and what of Islam and ISIS "" If all of the races intermix too much , there will be no solid white resistance to the international Zionists , and all the races will be enslaved Islam is growing in the black community , and I think people will be surprised to hear me say this , but Islam represents discipline in many ways And for the black community , those involved in the Nation of Islam – a black organization here tend to be well disciplined and not involved in drugs , crime , murder , etc , and tends to want to separate from white people – if anything , we are all for blacks getting involved in Nation of Islam Regarding ISIS , there does appear to be some connection to the Zionist regime being behind this organization , and it does appear to be aimed at destabilizing Iran , Syria , and perhaps other nations who refuse to bow down to the Zionist terror state in occupied Palestine How about the pro-white music industry "" The pro-white music industry is important , ever since Ian Stuart started the musical revolution with Skrewdriver , it's been an important component to the white struggle It does seem that less bands are active currently , and concerts are fewer than before ; however that can easily turn back around One needs to remember that with online music and file sharing , it really hurt the music industry as a whole , even mainstream bands In our scene , it was even harder hit But , times change , and we adapt to the changes We do have a label , NSM 88 Records , and we ship worldwide with customers and support from all over the white world , so in that aspect the fight goes on . In conclusion ... "" We are always ready for a fight , and it happens sometimes , and at times weapons do come into these demonstrations , but usually from the Antifa , not our people We get death threats often , and at the most recent rally we did ... with the KKK and NSM at the State Capitol in South Carolina , we were told one of the Antifa or black gang members came in with a gun , and another with a knife , so it can be dangerous – but we fight on regardless We are usually outnumbered by the Antifa , but it does not concern us Each one of us has more fight in us than four Antifa Let them come and see what happens if they attack us "" We salute all the white organizations who are fighting worldwide for National Socialism We are all a brotherhood whom support the cause of national socialism – now and forever - - until victory or Valhalla !

""Can't we problem solve in a way free of judgment to stop gun trafficking , drug sales , gangs , terrorists entering and leaving as they will while the feds look the other way and not enforce a tight sealed border wall If Americans blame foreigners perhaps we should do the field agriculture jobs , or be willing to do housework instead of relying on others The technology of automation brought progress but we haven't spent our time gained responsibly Americans are becoming obese watching football and the Simpsons cartoons instead of coming to our brothers ' need Do not promise a refugee a handout because what is given free is not earned and cheats everyone The Founding Fathers , Puritans and Pilgrims came here for a country to live in freedom and righteous living – not for a chance to make money , own homes , or see children graduate from college These people who came before us sometimes made the best of economic less but their reliance upon their own divine spirituality and each other inspires us to carry on with a belief and desire to return the United States to the greatness that we so have so nearly forsaken out of love of materialist comfort ""That's why capitalism and the socialist revolution are not solutions to our problems We must support nation-building , a state that we can all help and defend , living ideals by work and frugality , and helping families play and stay together to strengthen our towns and cities We want our children productive too No , dividing our country because of self gratification and stealing others ' opportunities just makes us all poorer Kindness and forgiveness demand concern for our brothers ' needs ; we invite you to read our website www.NSM88.org See how you can help , and whatever you do , Join now "
