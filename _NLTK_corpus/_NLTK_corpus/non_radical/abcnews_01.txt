Thirteen years after the September 11 terrorist attacks, New York's World Trade Centre has reopened for business. About 200 employees of publishing giant Conde Nast began moving into the skyscraper on Monday, led by company chief executive Charles Townsend. "This is a terrific day for Lower Manhattan, a wonderful day for New York City and an absolutely great day for Conde Nast," Mr Townsend said. The publishing company, which owns The New Yorker, Vanity Fair and other magazines, is the first tenant to set up offices in America's tallest skyscraper, where it will occupy floors 20 to 44. About 3,400 Conde Nast employees will have moved into the 104-storey gleaming tower in Lower Manhattan by February 2015. Staff entering their company's new headquarters echoed their leader's excitement while downplaying security concerns. "I can understand the fear," finance analyst Vijay Ramcharitar said. "But I don't think you look at this building with fear, you look at it with inspiration." One World Trade Centre stands on the location where more than 2,700 people perished when hijacked planes slammed into the twin towers on September 11, 2001. It is directly across from the 9/11 Memorial. Maryanne Casey, who works for a legal affiliate of Conde Nast, said moving into her new office evoked personal memories. She once worked at the World Trade Centre and her firefighter brother helped in the aftermath of the attacks. "It's a great tribute to America to see this," she said. "I'm very proud to work here." Construction workers who helped the $US3.9 billion tower rise from the rubble, overcoming repeated delays that pushed back the original 2006 completion date, put finishing touches on the building's glass exterior and watched with pride as its first tenants settled in. "It's a great building," one worker said. The new tower is about 60 per cent leased so far.
